# Lambda MOO Programming

## Introduction
The primary purpose of this repository is to aggregate and update the existing LambdaMOO Programming Resources that exist. The core of the work done here has been to converted the original MOO Programmer's Manual written by Pavel Curtis to HTML5/Bootstrap and to update each section of the manual with additional information.

There are a number of other files included in this repository. Many are all scraped from various websites that continue to exist, somehow, to this day. Most are at least 15 years old. I have included them here for posterity, since losing them would be tragic.

## Contents
There are two versions of each document in this repository. One is a markdown copy located in [/tutorials](/tutorials) which is accessible on GitHub and one is an HTML version located in [/tutorials/src](/tutorials/src).

### Lambda MOO Programmer's Manual [Updated]
The LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual is an updated and expanded version of the LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual originally written by Pavel Curtis.

#### On GitHub
To use this guide you simply need to open [MOO Programmer's Manual](/tutorials/moo-programmers-manual-updated.md). This version of the MOO Programmer's Manual lacks much of the formatting that the HTML5 version below has. It is great for quick perusal, but the HTML version is superior. 

#### Locally
To use this guide locally you simply need clone it and open [/tutorials/src/moo-programmers-manual-updated](/tutorials/src/moo-programmers-manual-updated.html) in your web browser.

## Author
[Sindome](https://www.sindome.org/) has been online since 1997. I've been playing it since 2003.  I've been developing in MOO since 2005, and a developer on Sindome since 2006. Ours is heavily modified, we have roughly 70-80 players online a lot of time time and dozens of people have developed the game over 20+ year run.  We've got a ton of best practices and design patterns that we implement in order to keep the MOO happy and healthy.  I've attempted to distill as much of that into this document while at the same time present the document in a more up to date format.

Text based gaming is an important part of our history and our future.  No game is more accessible to those with handicaps, for example.

Come visit me on Sindome if you dare :)
