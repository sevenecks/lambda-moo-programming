## Contributing
Please feel free to fork the repo and contribute.  This is a labor of love.  I've been using LambdaMOO since 2003 and I wanted to give back to the community.  Text based gaming is an important part of our history and our future.  No game is more accessible to those with handicaps, for example.

## Author and Purpose
I've been developing on a LambdaMOO core since 2003.  Ours is heavily modified, we have roughly 60-70 players online a lot of time time and dozens of people have developed the game over it's almost 20 year run.  We've got a ton of best practices and design patterns that we implement in order to keep the MOO happy and healthy.  I've attempted to distill as much of that into this document while at the same time present the document in a more up to date format.
