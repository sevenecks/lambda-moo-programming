# The New Moo Programming Guide
The New MOO Programming Guide is an updated and expanded version of the LambdaMOO Programming Guide originally written by Pavel Curtis. It is located in the *[moo.html](moo.html)* file.

There are a number of other files included in this repository. They are all scraped from various websites that continue to exist, somehow, to this day. Most are at least 15 years old. I have included them here for posterity, since losing them would be tragic. They are not HTML5, but my goal is to eventually convert them to HTML5, or perhaps to Markdown.

# Usage
To use this guide you simply need clone it and open [moo.html](moo.html) in your web browser.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SevenEcks/the-new-moo-programming-guide.git
```

# Changes
See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

## Notes
1. This is a work in progress
2. The stylesheet can be swapped out with a normal bootstrap style sheet.
3. I've tried to format the functions in a more modern way
4. Estimated Hours: 20

## TODO
1. Finish full HTML5 conversion
2. Finish applying proper styles to elements
3. Create an index / TOC
4. ~~Link to relevant GitHub Repositories for LambdaMOO DBs~~
5. Add more advanced programming examples
6. Add a section on benchmarking
7. Add a section on LambdaMOO plugins / extensions
8. Current editing progress: Line 3,351
9. Confirm all function-is-member id's are set to function names
10. Confirm all Hx elements are properly set
11. Convert all secondary files to markdown or HTML5.
12. Consider converting HTML5 moo guide to markdown for easy github viewing
13. Deploy guide to a website for easy HTML5 viewing

## Contributing
Please feel free to fork the repo and contribute.  This is a labor of love.  I've been using LambdaMOO since 2003 and I wanted to give back to the community.  Text based gaming is an important part of our history and our future.  No game is more accessible to those with handicaps, for example.

## Author and Purpose
[Sindome](https://www.sindome.org/) has been online since 1997. I've been playing it since 2003.  I've been developing in MOO since 2005, and a developer on Sindome since 2006. Ours is heavily modified, we have roughly 70-80 players online a lot of time time and dozens of people have developed the game over 20+ year run.  We've got a ton of best practices and design patterns that we implement in order to keep the MOO happy and healthy.  I've attempted to distill as much of that into this document while at the same time present the document in a more up to date format.

Come visit us if you dare :)
