            <h3>
              <a name="A1.1" id="A1.1">Introduction</a>
            </h3>This is a programming example of reasonable
            complexity. We are going to demonstrate property use,
            forking, and generic object use.
            <p>
              Our example is a wind-up toy. The basic things that a
              wind-up toy does is get wound, and then slowly wind
              its way down, hopping or rolling or twirling along.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, let's create a couple of objects to work from.
            </p>
            <pre>
  @create $thing named Generic Wind-Up Toy,Toy
  You now have Generic Wind-Up Toy (aka Toy) with object number #12221
  and parent generic thing (#5).

  @create #12221 named Wind-Up Duck,Duck
  You now have Wind-Up Duck (aka Duck) with object number #12222 and
  parent Generic Wind-Up Toy (#12221).
</pre>We'll refer to these as Toy and Duck, the aliases we gave in
the @create command.
            <h3>
              <a name="A1.2" id="A1.2">Simple Wind</a>
            </h3>First, we need some way to tell if the toy has
            been wound up. We'll create a property called "wound"
            on the generic toy.
            <pre>
  @property toy.wound 0
  Property added with value 0.
</pre>Before we can write our program, we need a verb... We want to
give commands like "wind duck" so we give it an argument list of
"this". The variable "this", when used inside a verb, refers to the
actual object (e.g. the duck) on which the verb called. Its place
in the argument list designates how the verb will be found by the
built-in parser.
            <pre>
  @verb toy:wind this
  Verb added.
</pre>Now we can make a simple program to wind the toy.
            <pre>
  @program toy:wind
  this.wound = this.wound + 2;
  player:tell("You wind up the ", this.name,".");
  player.location:announce(player.name, " winds up the ", this.name,".");
  .
</pre>Remember that "this" takes the place of whatever we will type
in place of "this" in our command line, so when the program runs,
it will change the .wound property of the duck. "Player" is the
person who types the command. These are built in variables
available in every program, they just take on different meanings
depending on who types the command and what object is used in the
command. The idea behind adding 2 to this.wound is that you can
wind it a bunch of times to make it go longer.
            <p>
              Let's try it on our duck:
            </p>
            <pre>
  wind duck
  You wind up the Wind-Up Duck.
</pre>Everyone else sees:
            <pre>
  yduJ winds up the Wind-Up Duck.
</pre>
            <h3>
              <a name="A1.3" id="A1.3">Simple Messages</a>
            </h3>Next, we want to make the duck actually move
            around. Remember that we're doing all the programming
            on the generic toy, and using the specific instance of
            the duck to test things out. To be properly generic, we
            need to define different properties that can hold
            message strings for the motions of the toy. So let's
            define two messages. One for the toy to start moving,
            and another for it to print as it continues to wind
            down.
            <pre>
  @property toy.startup_msg ""
  Property added with value "".

  @property toy.continue_msg ""
  Property added with value "".
</pre>We named these with "_msg" in order for the messages to show
up in @messages, and be settable with the @message_name object is
"text" command. (See help @messages for more details.) Let's set
values of these messages on the duck. While we're at it, we should
give our duck a description!
            <pre>
  @startup duck is "waddles about and starts rolling forward."
  You set the "startup" message of Wind-Up Duck (#12222).
  @continue duck is "swivels its neck and emits a &gt;&gt; Quack &lt;&lt;"
  You set the "continue" message of Wind-Up Duck (#12222).
  @describe duck as "A yellow plastic duck with wheels at the bottom and a knob
  for winding."
  Description set.
</pre>
            <h3>
              <a name="A1.4" id="A1.4">Simple Drop</a>
            </h3>We should be ready to roll now... We're going to
            have the wind up toy start up when the player drops it.
            This introduces another concept, that of specializing
            an existing verb. The generic thing ($thing) defines
            the verb :drop. Normally, if we type "drop duck" the
            verb on $thing gets invoked on the duck (even though
            it's a few levels removed from $thing). If we define a
            :drop verb on the generic toy, we don't want to have to
            type in all the code from $thing:drop; we just want to
            have our new code executed after the normal drop gets
            done. In order to get both things, we use the primitive
            pass(@args).
            <p>
              This is the slipperiest concept in MOO programming,
              yet the basis for the entire object oriented nature
              of the MOO. An easy way to think of pass is like
              another verb call: it just does the "basic thing"
              that this verb normally does. We can add our
              specialization code both before and after this basic
              thing. The @args part means just to use the same verb
              arguments in the base case as we do in our
              specialization. More sophisticated users of pass may
              wish to change these arguments; for now, just take it
              as gospel. Sometimes you won't want to use pass at
              all, if you don't want the basic thing to happen, but
              want to completely override the default behavior.
              This is OK, you just have to think about what you
              want when deciding whether and where to put the call
              to pass(@args).
            </p>
            <p>
              We want the dropping to happen before any of our
              startup, so we call pass(@args) right away. We better
              check if the toy has been wound up, and not do
              anything special if it hasn't. Next, we print out our
              startup message, and schedule some tasks to be run a
              little later to print out the progress of our toy.
              Let's pick every 15 seconds to print out a message,
              and print out as many messages as we have in
              this.wound. Each time it actually prints a message,
              it will "unwind" a little, so we decrement
              this.wound. Note that the stuff between the fork and
              the endfork doesn't get done until the fork actually
              starts, and the forks start 15, 30, 45, etc. seconds
              after all the code in our drop verb has finished.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our @verb command looks a little funny, because we're
              forced into using some more advanced features of MOO
              verbs. If you have a verb named foo*bar, then in
              order to invoke that verb, the user must type at
              least "foo", and may type any part of "bar" that they
              like; the * is putting in an abbreviation.
              $thing:drop has these abbreviations built in, so you
              can just type "d object" to drop something. Also,
              drop has a synonym, "throw" (more properly, th*row).
              Putting both verbs in a double-quoted string is the
              way to say "two names for this verb". Really, any
              number of synonyms are possible. We'll continue to
              refer to this verb as "drop", even though we could
              just as truthfully refer to it as "throw". We use
              these names because we want to name our verb exactly
              the same as the one on $thing, so people who prefer
              to use "throw" will still get our specializations.
            </p>
            <pre>
  @verb toy:"d*rop th*row" this
  Verb added.

  @program toy:drop
  pass(@args);
  if (this.wound)
    this.location:announce_all(this.name, " ", this.startup_msg);
    for x in [1..this.wound]
      fork (x * 15)
        this.location:announce_all(this.name," ", this.continue_msg);
        this.wound = this.wound - 1;
      endfork
    endfor
  endif
  .
</pre>It's worth noting that 0 in MOO is also "false" as well as
being "zero", which is convenient. Thus we didn't have to use
(this.wound!=0) in our if statement, but could use just
(this.wound).
            <p>
              Now, let's drop our duck and see how it works!
            </p>
            <pre>
  drop duck
  You drop Wind-Up Duck.
  Wind-Up Duck waddles about and starts rolling forward.
  Wind-Up Duck swivels its neck and emits a &gt;&gt; Quack &lt;&lt;
  Wind-Up Duck swivels its neck and emits a &gt;&gt; Quack &lt;&lt;
</pre>It actually waited 15 seconds in between each of those
messages. I tried it again, but this time I typed @forked right
away to see that the tasks had been scheduled:
            <pre>

              <a name="A2" id="A2">Chapter 2: A More Complex
              Object</a>
            </h2>How could we improve on our wind-up toy? Or,
            rather, what are some of its problems?
            <p>
              What happens when someone picks up the toy while it's
              going? What if you try to drop it somewhere you're
              not allowed to? Perhaps we should only allow someone
              to wind it up if they are holding it. What if someone
              winds it five thousand times? Perhaps we should allow
              programmers to make more complicated messages on
              their child objects.
            </p>
            <p>
              We'll address each of these issues in chapter 2.
            </p>
            <h3>
              <a name="A2.1" id="A2.1">Complex Wind</a>
            </h3>Let's start with requiring someone to be holding
            the duck in order to wind it. We take the code from
            before, and stick an if/else/endif around it.
            <pre>
  @program toy:wind
  if (this.location == player)
    this.wound = this.wound + 2;
    player:tell("You wind up the ", this.name,".");
    player.location:announce(player.name, " winds up the ", this.name,".");
  else
    player:tell("You have to be holding the ", this.name,".");
  endif
  .
</pre>That was simple enough... again 'this' is whatever wind-up
toy was wound, and 'this.location' is where the toy is now. If it
is in the player's inventory then this.location will be equal to
the variable 'player'.
            <p>
              Let's complicate the code once more, and then we'll
              be done with the :wind verb. We should have a maximum
              number of turns the toy will allow, otherwise a
              malicious player could spend a few hours winding the
              toy, and then unleash it on an unsuspecting public.
              If we wanted to be really fancy, we could make the
              toy break if they wound it too far, and require then
              to repair it with a screwdriver (which we would
              create for the purpose), but let's leave that as an
              exercise for the reader.
            </p>
            <p>
              We create a property for the maximum number of turns,
              so different toys can have different maximums. We'll
              give it a default value of 20, though, so it doesn't
              have to be set for each new toy.
            </p>
            <pre>
  @property toy.maximum 20
  Property added with value 20.
</pre>Now we insert another set of if/else/endifs inside our
current set.
            <pre>
  @program toy:wind
  if (this.location == player)
    if (this.wound &lt; this.maximum)
      this.wound = this.wound + 2;
      player:tell("You wind up the ", this.name,".");
      player.location:announce(player.name, " winds up the ", this.name,".");
      if (this.wound &gt;= this.maximum)
        player:tell("The knob comes to a stop while winding.");
      endif
    else
      player:tell("The ",this.name," is already fully wound.");
    endif
  else
    player:tell("You have to be holding the ", this.name,".");
  endif
  .
</pre>In order to add to the feel of the toy, we put in another
test: if, after adding 2 to the wound property, it has reached the
maximum, we tell the player they've come to the end. The more
completely you can describe an object's actions and responses to
actions, the richer the feel of the Virtual Reality.
            <h3>
              <a name="A2.2" id="A2.2">Complex Messages</a>
            </h3>Earlier we showed how to make user settable
            messages on an object. Now we will show how to enable
            another programmer make more complicated messages on
            eir windup toy.
            <p>
              A simple yet very useful method is to define a verb
              for each message property, which just returns that
              property, and then have all the uses of that property
              use the verb instead. For example:
            </p>
            <pre>
  @verb toy:continue_msg this none this
  @program toy:continue_msg
  return this.continue_msg;
  .
</pre>However, it seems almost silly to make a whole bunch of
verbs, one for each property... And indeed it is. The built-in
variable "verb" is always set to the name that this verb was
invoked with, so we can get all the messages in one verb, with this
idiom:
            <pre>
  @verb toy:"wind_down_msg continue_msg startup_msg going_msg" this none this
  @program toy:continue_msg
  return this.(verb);
  .
</pre>There's a lot of stuff to explain in this little bit of code!
First, the syntax of the @verb command, with the several messages
listed in a quoted string, indicates that each of those names is an
alias for the verbname, and the verb can be invoked by any of those
names. Second, the builtin variable "verb" is set to whichever name
was actually used. This enables the property reference to be a
simple construction from the verb name, using the expression syntax
for property references, <object>
              .(), where in this case expression is a simple
              variable reference.
              <p>
                Here's an example of how we can customize just one
                of those messages programmatically with the wind-up
                duck. In the continue_msg we'll make the duck quack
                once, twice, or thrice, randomly. We leave the
                other messages alone, as we'll just be using static
                text.
              </p>
              <pre>
  @verb duck:continue_msg this none this
  @program duck:continue_msg
  times = {"once","twice","thrice"}[random(3)];
  return "swivels its neck and quacks " + times + ".";
  .
</pre>
              <h3>
                <a name="A2.3" id="A2.3">Complex Drop</a>
              </h3>Let's tackle the drop verb now. There are a lot
              of problems. First, what happens if someone picks up
              the toy while it's still going? The messages still
              appear! What should happen? Two ideas come to mind:
              1. It should fully discharge its windings, as real
              life windup toys are wont to do; 2. It should just
              stop running, as though the player had grabbed the
              windup knob to prevent it from further discharge.
              We'll choose option 2 for our example. Option 1 would
              be easiest to do by specializing the existing "take"
              verb to reduce the .wound property to 0, printing
              appropriate messages.
              <p>
                The major problem with our drop verb is that it
                schedules all its tasks at one time. Once
                scheduled, they *will* run, whether or not the
                situation has changed. To solve this problem, we
                only schedule one task at a time, making it the job
                of that task to figure out whether it has wound
                down, and schedule another task. It should also
                check if it has been picked up; if so it should
                neither print messages nor schedule the next task.
              </p>
              <p>
                Having called this section "Complex Drop", we're
                going to defer the complexity to an auxiliary verb,
                and make Drop itself simpler.
              </p>
              <pre>
  @program toy:drop
  pass(@args);
  if (this.wound)
    this.location:announce_all(this.name, " ", this:startup_msg());
    fork (15)
      this:do_the_work();
    endfork
  endif
  .
</pre>We will use the special arguments "this none this" in our
@verb command. This is a special kluge that means this verb is not
a command, and cannot be typed at the command line. It also won't
show up in @examine commands. This helps to keep down the clutter
of @examine, and because this verb is only an internal function, it
wouldn't make sense to type as a command line.
              <pre>
  @verb toy:do_the_work this none this
  if (this.wound)
    if ($object_utils:isa(this.location,$room))
      this.location:announce_all(this.name," ", this:continue_msg());
      this.wound = this.wound - 1;
      if (this.wound)
        fork (15)
          this:do_the_work();
        endfork
      else
        this.location:announce_all(this.name, " ", this:wind_down_msg());
      endif
    endif
    if (this.wound &lt; 0)
      this.wound = 0;
    endif
  endif
</pre>Let's go through this step by step. First we check if we're
still wound up. Theoretically this should always be true, but it's
best to check. Assuming .would is true (that is, nonzero), we check
to see if we're in a room. The utility function
$object_utils:isa(x,y) checks to see if an object X will behave as
an object Y, that is, if Y is in the object's ancestor tree. We do
this because we only want to make our noises if we're wandering
around in a room. A player won't be a room, and so won't pass this
test. Now, we print our message, and decrement this.wound to say
we've wound down once. Next we think about scheduling the next
task. We check this.wound again, because if we subtracted the last
bit, we don't want to bother scheduling it. Note that we call this
very same verb, this:do_the_work. Just for extra feeling, we put in
a new message to be printed when the toy has actually wound down.
Oops! Better add that property... And finally, at the very end,
we've gotten all anal retentive with error checking and made sure
that this.wound never gets into negative numbers. (Notice that if
it *did* get into negative numbers, it would never stop. So this
check is not entirely pointless!)
              <pre>
  @property toy.wind_down_msg ""
  Property added with value "".

  @wind_down duck is "hiccups once and stops rolling."
  You set the "wind_down" message of Wind-Up Duck (#12222).

                <a name="A3.1" id="A3.1">Description</a>
              </h3>It might be nice if you could tell by looking at
              the toy that it was moving, and not have to wait for
              it to tell you so. Like "drop", this is done by
              specializing an already existing verb, called
              description, by calling pass(@args) and then doing
              some additional stuff. There are a number of relevant
              differences between this and most other verbs,
              however.
              <p>
                Most verbs do something, that is, when you type a
                command, it produces a set of messages, and changes
                some properties on some objects. Some verbs,
                however, are not commands, and don't even print any
                messages. Instead, they return a value to the
                calling verb, for that verb to use to produce
                messages or change properties. These are analogous
                to "functions" in other languages. Description is
                one such verb. By default, that is, in the basic
                case, it returns the property 'this.description'.
                Verbs like 'look' call description on objects and
                print out the strings they return. So when we
                specialize description, we won't be calling
                pass(@args) all by itself, and then printing out
                more text, instead we'll call pass(@args), add text
                to that, and return the whole pile.
              </p>
              <p>
                Again because we're trying to write generically, we
                create a property to hold a message to be added to
                the description when the toy is running, and we set
                it for the duck.
              </p>
              <pre>
  @property toy.going_msg ""
  Property added with value "".

  @going duck is "The duck is rolling forward with a slight waddle."
  You set the "going" message of Wind-Up Duck (#12222).
</pre>The description verb again needs the "this none this" args,
since it is just an internal verb called by programs.
              <pre>
  @verb toy:description this none this
  Verb added.

  @program toy:description;
  basic = pass(@args);
  if (this.wound)
    return basic + " " + this:going_msg();
  else
    return basic;
  endif
  .
</pre>Pretty simple code, huh? First we call pass. We store away
that text in a variable 'basic', because we'll need it later. Then
we check to see if we're wound up. If we are, we return the basic
information plus our going_msg. We put in a couple of spaces to
separate the sentences. Otherwise, we're quiet, and we just return
the basic string. What does it look like?
              <pre>
  look duck
  A yellow plastic duck with wheels at the bottom and a knob for winding.  The
  duck is rolling forward with a slight waddle.

                <a name="A3.2" id="A3.2">Permissions</a>
              </h3>To allow other people to create their own
              wind-up toys, we set the generic toy world-readable
              and `fertile':
              <pre>
  @chmod toy rf
  Object permissions set to rf.
</pre>This isn't really good enough, due to the screwinesses of the
MOO permission system. Generally speaking, when you create an
object, you become the owner of all its properties as well. This is
called "having c permissions". But that means that someone else
(including the owner of the *verb* on the object) can't change the
property. To get around this problem, we set the wound property !c
(meaning "not c"). Then the wound property always belongs to the
owner of the generic toy, and not to the creator of any specific
instance.
              <pre>
  @chmod toy.wound !c
  Property permissions set to r.
</pre>It tells us what the permissions ended up being, after
stripping off the "c", which is "r" for readable.
