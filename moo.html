<h2 id="foreword">Foreword</h2>
<p>Hey, it's me: Brendan.  The guy updating this document.  The idea of updating the MOO Programming Manual 
has crossed my mind a few times.  It's a bit of a daunting task.  This document is pretty comprehensive and 
I'm endeavouring to make it even more so.  I'm adding some much needed styling so that it looks more modern.  
Things were once hosted primarily  on FTP servers and we now have GitHub, so many links and resources mentioned 
in this document have been updated and I've even added some additional ones.</p>
<p>If you want an up to date manual on MOO, this is the gudie for you.  If you want to read the historic document 
which contains the unedited text, I recommend reviewing the links toward the top of the page that point to unedited
versions of the guide.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>LambdaMOO is a network-accessible, multi-user, programmable, interactive
system well-suited to the construction of text-based adventure games,
conferencing systems, and other collaborative software.  Its most common use,
however, is as a multi-participant, low-bandwidth virtual reality, and it is
with this focus in mind that I describe it here.</p>
<p>Participants (usually referred to as <em>players</em>) connect to LambdaMOO using
Telnet or some other, more specialized, <em>client</em> program.  Upon
connection, they are usually presented with a <em>welcome message</em> explaining
how to either create a new <em>character</em> or connect to an existing one.
Characters are the embodiment of players in the virtual reality that is
LambdaMOO.</p>
<p>Having connected to a character, players then give one-line commands that are
parsed and interpreted by LambdaMOO as appropriate.  Such commands may cause
changes in the virtual reality, such as the location of a character, or may
simply report on the current state of that reality, such as the appearance of
some object.</p>
<p>The job of interpreting those commands is shared between the two major
components in the LambdaMOO system: the <em>server</em> and the <em>database</em>.
The server is a program, written in a standard programming language, that
manages the network connections, maintains queues of commands and other tasks
to be executed, controls all access to the database, and executes other
programs written in the MOO programming language.  The database contains
representations of all the objects in the virtual reality, including the MOO
programs that the server executes to give those objects their specific
behaviors.</p>
<p>Almost every command is parsed by the server into a call on a MOO procedure,
or <em>verb</em>, that actually does the work.  Thus, programming in the MOO
language is a central part of making non-trivial extensions to the database
and thus, the virtual reality.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, I describe the structure and contents of a LambdaMOO
database.  The following chapter gives a complete description of how the
server performs its primary duty: parsing the commands typed by players.
Next, I describe the complete syntax and semantics of the MOO programming
language.  Finally, I describe all of the database conventions assumed by the
server.</p>
<div class="well">
    <span class="label label-info">Note:</span> This manual describes only those aspects of LambdaMOO that are
    entirely independent of the contents of the database.  It does not describe,
    for example, the commands or programming interfaces present in the LambdaCore
    database.
</div>
<h2 id="lambdaMOO-database">The LambdaMOO Database</h2>
<p>In this chapter, I begin by describing in detail the various kinds of data
that can appear in a LambdaMOO database and that, therefore, MOO programs can
manipulate.  In a few places, I refer to the <em>LambdaCore</em> database.  This
is one particular LambdaMOO database, created every so often by extracting the
"core" of the current database for the original LambdaMOO.</p>
<div class="well">
    <span class="label label-info">Note:</span> The original LambdaMOO resides on the host
    <span class="cmd">lambda.parc.xerox.com</span> (the numeric address for which is
    <span class="cmd">192.216.54.2</span>), on port 8888.  Feel free to drop by!  A copy of the most
    recent release of the LambdaCore database can be obtained by anonymous FTP from
    host <span class="cmd">ftp.parc.xerox.com</span> in the directory <span class="cmd">pub/MOO</span>.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    The above information may be out of date, but the most recent dump of the <em>LambdaCore</em> 
    can be found <a href="http://lambda.moo.mud.org/pub/MOO/" target="_blank">here</a>.
</div>
<h3>MOO Value Types</a></h3>
<p>There are only a few kinds of values that MOO programs can manipulate:
<ul>
    <li>integers (in a specific, large range)</li>
    <li>real numbers (represented with floating-point numbers)</li>
    <li>strings (of characters)</li>
    <li>objects (in the virtual reality)</li>
    <li>errors (arising during program execution)</li>
    <li>lists (of all of the above, including lists)</li>
</ul>
<p>MOO supports the integers from -2^31 (that is, negative two to the power
of 31) up to 2^31 - 1 (one less than two to the power of 31); that's
from -2147483648 to 2147483647, enough for most purposes.  In MOO
programs, integers are written just as you see them here, an optional minus
sign followed by a non-empty sequence of decimal digits.  In particular, you
may not put commas, periods, or spaces in the middle of large integers, as we
sometimes do in English and other natural languages (e.g., `2,147,483,647').<p>
Real numbers in MOO are represented as they are in almost all other programming
languages, using so-called <em>floating-point</em> numbers.  These have certain
(large) limits on size and precision that make them useful for a wide range of
applications.  Floating-point numbers are written with an optional minus sign
followed by a non-empty sequence of digits punctuated at some point with a
decimal point (`.') and/or followed by a scientific-notation marker (the letter
`E' or `e' followed by an optional sign and one or more digits).  Here are some
examples of floating-point numbers:</p>
<pre>325.0   325.   3.25e2   0.325E3   325.E1   .0325e+4   32500e-2</pre>
<p>All of these examples mean the same number.  The third of these, as an example
of scientific notation, should be read "3.25 times 10 to the power of 2".</p>
<div class="well">
    <span class="label label-info">Fine point:</span> The MOO represents floating-point numbers using the local
    meaning of the C-language <span class="cmd">double</span> type, which is almost always equivalent
    to IEEE 754 double precision floating point.  If so, then the smallest positive
    floating-point number is no larger than <span class="cmd">2.2250738585072014e-308</span> and the
    largest floating-point number is <span class="cmd">1.7976931348623157e+308</span>.
        <ul>
        <li>IEEE infinities and NaN values are not allowed in MOO.</li>
        <li>The error <span class="cmd">E_FLOAT</span> is raised whenever an infinity would otherwise be computed.</li>
        <li>The error <span class="cmd">E_INVARG</span> is raised whenever a NaN would otherwise arise.</li>  
        <li>The value <span class="cmd">0.0</span> is always returned on underflow.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>Character <em>strings</em> are arbitrarily-long sequences of normal, ASCII
printing characters.  When written as values in a program, strings are
enclosed in double-quotes, like this:</p>
<pre>"This is a character string."</pre>
<p>To include a double-quote in the string, precede it with a backslash
(<span class="cmd">\</span>), like this:
<pre>"His name was \"Leroy\", but nobody ever called him that."</pre>
<p>Finally, to include a backslash in a string, double it:</p>
<pre>"Some people use backslash ('\\') to mean set difference."</pre>
<p>MOO strings may not include special ASCII characters like carriage-return,
line-feed, bell, etc.  The only non-printing characters allowed are spaces and
tabs.</p>
<div class="well">
<span class="label label-info">Fine point:</span> There is a special kind of string used for representing the
arbitrary bytes used in general, binary input and output.  In a <em>binary
string</em>, any byte that isn't an ASCII printing character or the space character
is represented as the three-character substring "~XX", where XX is the
hexadecimal representation of the byte; the input character `~' is represented
by the three-character substring "~7E".  This special representation is used by
the functions <span class="cmd">encode_binary()</span> and <span class="cmd">decode_binary()</span> and by the
functions <span class="cmd">notify()</span> and <span class="cmd">read()</span> with network connections that are
in binary mode.  See the descriptions of the <span class="cmd">set_connection_option()</span>,
<span class="cmd">encode_binary()</span>, and <span class="cmd">decode_binary()</span> functions for more details.
</div>
<p><em>Objects</em> are the backbone of the MOO database and, as such, deserve a
great deal of discussion; the entire next section is devoted to them.  For now,
let it suffice to say that every object has a number, unique to that object.</p>
<p>In programs, we write a reference to a particular object by putting a hash mark
(<span class="cmd">#</span>) followed by the number, like this:</p>
<pre>#495</pre>
<p>Object numbers are always integers.</p>
<p>There are three special object numbers used for a variety of purposes:
<span class="cmd">#-1</span>, <span class="cmd">#-2</span>, and <span class="cmd">#-3</span>, usually referred to in the
LambdaCore database as <span class="cmd">$nothing</span>, <span class="cmd">$ambiguous_match</span>, and
<span class="cmd">$failed_match</span>, respectively.</p>
<p><em>Errors</em> are, by far, the least frequently used values in MOO.  In the
normal case, when a program attempts an operation that is erroneous for some
reason (for example, trying to add a number to a character string), the server
stops running the program and prints out an error message.  However, it is
possible for a program to stipulate that such errors should not stop execution;
instead, the server should just let the value of the operation be an error
value.  The program can then test for such a result and take some appropriate
kind of recovery action.  In programs, error values are written as words
beginning with <span class="cmd">E_</span>.  The complete list of error values, along with their
associated messages, is as follows:</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt>E_NONE</dt>
    <dd>No error</dd>
    <dt>E_TYPE</dt>
    <dd>Type mismatch</dd>
    <dt>E_DIV</dt>
    <dd>Division by zero</dd>
    <dt>E_PERM</dt>
    <dd>Permission denied</dd>
    <dt>E_PROPNF</dt>
    <dd>Property not found</dd>
    <dt>E_VERBNF</dt>
    <dd>Verb not found</dd>
    <dt>E_VARNF</dt>
    <dd>Variable not found</dd>
    <dt>E_INVIND</dt>
    <dd>Invalid indirection</dd>
    <dt>E_RECMOVE</dt>
    <dd>Recursive move</dd>
    <dt>E_MAXREC</dt>
    <dd>Too many verb calls</dd>
    <dt>E_RANGE</dt>
    <dd>Range error</dd>
    <dt>E_ARGS</dt>
    <dd>Incorrect number of arguments</dd>
    <dt>E_NACC</dt>
    <dd>Move refused by destination</dd>
    <dt>E_INVARG</dt>
    <dd>Invalid argument</dd>
    <dt>E_QUOTA</dt>
    <dd>Resource limit exceeded</dd>
    <dt>E_FLOAT</dt>
    <dd>Floating-point arithmetic error</dd>
</dl>
<p>The final kind of value in MOO programs is <em>lists</em>.  A list is a sequence
of arbitrary MOO values, possibly including other lists.  In programs,
lists are written in mathematical set notation with each of the elements
written out in order, separated by commas, the whole enclosed in curly
braces (<span class="cmd">{</span> and <span class="cmd">}</span>).  For example, a list of the names of
the days of the week is written like this:</p>
<pre>{"Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday",
 "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"}
</pre>
<div class="well">
    <span class="label label-info">Note:</span> It doesn't matter that we put a line-break in the middle of
    the list.  This is true in general in MOO: anywhere that a space can go,
    a line-break can go, with the same meaning.  The only exception is
    inside character strings, where line-breaks are not allowed.
</div>
<h3>Objects in the MOO Database</h3>
<p>Objects are, in a sense, the whole point of the MOO programming language.
They are used to represent objects in the virtual reality, like people, rooms,
exits, and other concrete things.  Because of this, MOO makes a bigger deal
out of creating objects than it does for other kinds of value, like integers.</p>
<p>Numbers always exist, in a sense; you have only to write them down in order to
operate on them.  With objects, it is different.  The object with number
<span class="cmd">#958</span> does not exist just because you write down its number.  An
explicit operation, the <span class="cmd">create()</span> function described later, is required
to bring an object into existence.  Symmetrically, once created, objects
continue to exist until they are explicitly destroyed by the <span class="cmd">recycle()</span>
function (also described later).</p>
<p>The identifying number associated with an object is unique to that
object.  It was assigned when the object was created and will never be
reused, even if the object is destroyed.  Thus, if we create an object
and it is assigned the number <span class="cmd">#1076</span>, the next object to be
created will be assigned <span class="cmd">#1077</span>, even if <span class="cmd">#1076</span> is destroyed
in the meantime.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    The above limitation led to design of systems to manage object reuse. The <span class="cmd">$recycler</span> 
    is one example of such a system.  This is <strong>not</strong> present in the <span class="cmd">minimal.db</span>
    which is included in the LambdaMOO source, however it is present in the latest dump of the 
    <a href="http://lambda.moo.mud.org/pub/MOO/">LambdaCore DB</a> which is the recommended starting point for new development.
</div>
<p>Every object is made up of three kinds of pieces that together define its
behavior: <em>attributes</em>, <em>properties</em>, and <em>verbs</em>.</p>
<h4>Fundamental Object Attributes</h4>
<p>There are three fundamental <em>attributes</em> to every object:</p>
<ol>
    <li>A flag (either true or false) specifying whether or not the object represents a player</li>
    <li>The object that is its <em>parent</em></li>
    <li>A list of the objects that are its <em>children</em>; that is, those objects for which this object is their parent.</li>
</ol>

<p>The act of creating a character sets the player attribute of an object and
only a wizard (using the function <span class="cmd">set_player_flag()</span>) can change that
setting.  Only characters have the player bit set to 1.</p>
<p>The parent/child hierarchy is used for classifying objects into general classes
and then sharing behavior among all members of that class.  For example, the
LambdaCore database contains an object representing a sort of "generic" room.
All other rooms are <em>descendants</em> (i.e., children or children's children,
or ...) of that one.  The generic room defines those pieces of behavior
that are common to all rooms; other rooms specialize that behavior for their
own purposes.  The notion of classes and specialization is the very essence of
what is meant by <em>object-oriented</em> programming.  Only the functions
<span class="cmd">create()</span>, <span class="cmd">recycle()</span>, 
<span class="cmd">chparent()</span>, and <span class="cmd">renumber()</cmd> can
change the parent and children attributes.</span>
<h4>Properties on Objects</h4>
<p>A <em>property</em> is a named "slot" in an object that can hold an arbitrary
MOO value.  Every object has eight built-in properties whose values are
constrained to be of particular types.  In addition, an object can have any
number of other properties, none of which have type constraints.  The built-in
properties are as follows:
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt>name</dt>
    <dd>a string, the usual name for this object</dd>
    <dt>owner</dt>
    <dd>an object, the player who controls access to it</dd>
    <dt>location</dt>
    <dd>an object, where the object is in virtual reality</dd>
    <dt>contents</dt>
    <dd>a list of objects, the inverse of <span class="cmd">location</span></dd>
    <dt>programmer</dt>
    <dd>a bit, does the object have programmer rights?</dd>
    <dt>wizard</dt>
    <dd>a bit, does the object have wizard rights?</dd>
    <dt>r</dt>
    <dd>a bit, is the object publicly readable?</dd>
    <dt>w</dt>
    <dd>a bit, is the object publicly writable?</dd>
    <dt>f</dt>
    <dd>a bit, is the object fertile?</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <span class="cmd">name</span> property is used to identify the object in various printed
messages.  It can only be set by a wizard or by the owner of the object.  For
player objects, the <span class="cmd">name</span> property can only be set by a wizard; this
allows the wizards, for example, to check that no two players have the same
name.</p>
<p>The <span class="cmd">owner</span> identifies the object that has owner rights to this object,
allowing them, for example, to change the <span class="cmd">name</span> property.  Only a wizard
can change the value of this property.</p>
<p>The <span class="cmd">location</span> and <span class="cmd">contents</span> properties describe a hierarchy of
object containment in the virtual reality.  Most objects are located
"inside" some other object and that other object is the value of the
<span class="cmd">location</span> property.</p>
<p>The <span class="cmd">contents</span> property is a list of those
objects for which this object is their location.  In order to maintain the
consistency of these properties, only the <span class="cmd">move()</span> function is able to
change them.</p>
<p>The <span class="cmd">wizard</span> and <span class="cmd">programmer</span> bits are only applicable to
characters, objects representing players.  They control permission to use
certain facilities in the server.  They may only be set by a wizard.</p>
<p>The <span class="cmd">r</span> bit controls whether or not players other than the owner of this
object can obtain a list of the properties or verbs in the object.</p>
<p>Symmetrically, the <span class="cmd">w</span> bit controls whether or not non-owners can add or
delete properties and/or verbs on this object.  The <span class="cmd">r</span> and <span class="cmd">w</span> bits
can only be set by a wizard or by the owner of the object.</p>
<p>The <span class="cmd">f</span> bit specifies whether or not this object is <em>fertile</em>, whether
or not players other than the owner of this object can create new objects with
this one as the parent.  It also controls whether or not non-owners can use the
<span class="cmd">chparent()</span> built-in function to make this object the parent of an
existing object.  The <span class="cmd">f</span> bit can only be set by a wizard or by the owner
of the object.</p>
<p>All of the built-in properties on any object can, by default, be read by any
player.  It is possible, however, to override this behavior from within the
database, making any of these properties readable only by wizards.  See the
chapter on server assumptions about the database for details.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, it is possible, and very useful, for objects to have other
properties aside from the built-in ones.  These can come from two sources.</p>
<p>First, an object has a property corresponding to every property in its parent
object.  To use the jargon of object-oriented programming, this is a kind of
<em>inheritance</em>.  If some object has a property named <span class="cmd">foo</span>, then so
will all of its children and thus its children's children, and so on.</p>
<p>Second, an object may have a new property defined only on itself and its
descendants.  For example, an object representing a rock might have properties
indicating its weight, chemical composition, and/or pointiness, depending upon
the uses to which the rock was to be put in the virtual reality.</p>
<p>Every defined property (as opposed to those that are built-in) has an owner
and a set of permissions for non-owners.  The owner of the property can get
and set the property's value and can change the non-owner permissions.  Only a
wizard can change the owner of a property.</p>
<p>The initial owner of a property is the player who added it; this is usually,
but not always, the player who owns the object to which the property was
added.  This is because properties can only be added by the object owner or a
wizard, unless the object is publicly writable (i.e., its <span class="cmd">w</span> property is
1), which is rare.  Thus, the owner of an object may not necessarily be the
owner of every (or even any) property on that object.</p>
<p>The permissions on properties are drawn from this set: <span class="cmd">r</span> (read),
<span class="cmd">w</span> (write), and <span class="cmd">c</span> (change ownership in descendants).  Read
permission lets non-owners get the value of the property and, of course, write
permission lets them set that value.  The <span class="cmd">c</span> permission bit is a little
more complicated.</p>
<p>Recall that every object has all of the properties that its parent does and
perhaps some more.  Ordinarily, when a child object inherits a property from
its parent, the owner of the child becomes the owner of that property.  This
is because the <span class="cmd">c</span> permission bit is "on" by default.  If the <span class="cmd">c</span>
bit is not on, then the inherited property has the same owner in the child as
it does in the parent.</p>
<p>As an example of where this can be useful, the LambdaCore database ensures
that every player has a <span class="cmd">password</span> property containing the encrypted
version of the player's connection password.  For security reasons, we don't
want other players to be able to see even the encrypted version of the
password, so we turn off the <span class="cmd">r</span> permission bit.  To ensure that the
password is only set in a consistent way (i.e., to the encrypted version of a
player's password), we don't want to let anyone but a wizard change the
property.  Thus, in the parent object for all players, we made a wizard the
owner of the password property and set the permissions to the empty string,
<span class="cmd">""</span>.  That is, non-owners cannot read or write the property and, because
the <span class="cmd">c</span> bit is not set, the wizard who owns the property on the parent
class also owns it on all of the descendants of that class.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
    <strong>Warning:</strong> The MOO will only hash the first 8 characters of a password. In practice
    this means that the passwords <span class="cmd">password</span> and <span class="cmd">password12345</span>
    are exactly the same and either one can be used to login.
</div>
<p>Another, perhaps more down-to-earth example arose when a character named Ford
started building objects he called "radios" and another character, yduJ,
wanted to own one.  Ford kindly made the generic radio object fertile, allowing
yduJ to create a child object of it, her own radio.  Radios had a property
called <span class="cmd">channel</span> that identified something corresponding to the frequency
to which the radio was tuned.  Ford had written nice programs on radios (verbs,
discussed below) for turning the channel selector on the front of the radio,
which would make a corresponding change in the value of the <span class="cmd">channel</span>
property.  However, whenever anyone tried to turn the channel selector on
yduJ's radio, they got a permissions error.  The problem concerned the
ownership of the <span class="cmd">channel</span> property.</p>
<p>As I explain later, programs run with the permissions of their author.  So, in
this case, Ford's nice verb for setting the channel ran with his permissions.
But, since the <span class="cmd">channel</span> property in the generic radio had the <span class="cmd">c</span>
permission bit set, the <span class="cmd">channel</span> property on yduJ's radio was owned by
her.  Ford didn't have permission to change it!  The fix was simple.  Ford
changed the permissions on the <span class="cmd">channel</span> property of the generic radio to
be just <span class="cmd">r</span>, without the <span class="cmd">c</span> bit, and yduJ made a new radio.  This
time, when yduJ's radio inherited the <span class="cmd">channel</span> property, yduJ did not
inherit ownership of it; Ford remained the owner.  Now the radio worked
properly, because Ford's verb had permission to change the channel.</p>
<h4>Verbs on Objects</h4>
<p>The final kind of piece making up an object is <em>verbs</em>.  A verb is a named
MOO program that is associated with a particular object.  Most verbs implement
commands that a player might type; for example, in the LambdaCore database,
there is a verb on all objects representing containers that implements
commands of the form <span class="cmd">put <var>object</var> in <var>container</var></span>.</p>
<p>It is also possible for MOO programs to invoke the verbs defined on objects.  Some verbs,
in fact, are designed to be used only from inside MOO code; they do not
correspond to any particular player command at all.  Thus, verbs in MOO are
like the <em>procedures</em> or <em>methods</em> found in some other programming languages.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">Note:</span> There are even more ways to refer to <em>verbs</em> and
    their counterparts in other programming language: <em>procedure</em>, <em>function</em>, <em>subroutine</em>, 
    <em>subprogram</em>, and <em>method</em> are the primary onces.  However, in <em>Object Oriented Programming</em> 
    abbreviated <em>OOP</em> you may primarily know them as methods.
</div>
<p>As with properties, every verb has an owner and a set of permission bits.  The
owner of a verb can change its program, its permission bits, and its argument
specifiers (discussed below).  Only a wizard can change the owner of a verb.</p>
<p>The owner of a verb also determines the permissions with which that verb runs;
that is, the program in a verb can do whatever operations the owner of that
verb is allowed to do and no others.  Thus, for example, a verb owned by a
wizard must be written very carefully, since wizards are allowed to do just
about anything.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
    <span class="label label-warning">Warning:</span> This is serious business.  The MOO has a variety of checks
    in place for permissions (at the object, verb and property levels) that are all but ignored when a verb is 
    executing with a wizard's permisisons.  You may want to create a non-wizard character and give them the 
    programmer bit, and write much of your code there, leaving the wizard bit for things that actually require
    access to everything, despite permissions.
</div>
<p>The permission bits on verbs are drawn from this set: <span class="cmd">r</span> (read),
<span class="cmd">w</span> (write), <span class="cmd">x</span> (execute), and <span class="cmd">d</span> (debug).  Read permission
lets non-owners see the program for a verb and, symmetrically, write
permission lets them change that program.  The other two bits are not,
properly speaking, permission bits at all; they have a universal effect,
covering both the owner and non-owners.</p>
<p>The execute bit determines whether or not the verb can be invoked from within
a MOO program (as opposed to from the command line, like the <span class="cmd">put</span> verb
on containers).  If the <span class="cmd">x</span> bit is not set, the verb cannot be called
from inside a program.  The <span class="cmd">x</span> bit is usually set.</p>
<p>The setting of the debug bit determines what happens when the verb's program
does something erroneous, like subtracting a number from a character string.
If the <span class="cmd">d</span> bit is set, then the server <em>raises</em> an error value; such
raised errors can be <em>caught</em> by certain other pieces of MOO code.  If the
error is not caught, however, the server aborts execution of the command and,
by default, prints an error message on the terminal of the player whose command
is being executed.  (See the chapter on server assumptions about the database
for details on how uncaught errors are handled.)  If the <span class="cmd">d</span> bit is not
set, then no error is raised, no message is printed, and the command is not
aborted; instead the error value is returned as the result of the erroneous
operation.</p>
<div class="well">
    <span class="label label-info">Note:</span> The <span class="cmd">d</span> bit exists only for historical reasons; it used to
    be the only way for MOO code to catch and handle errors.  With the introduction
    of the <span class="cmd">try</span>-<span class="cmd">except</span> statement and the error-catching expression,
    the <span class="cmd">d</span> bit is no longer useful.  All new verbs should have the <span class="cmd">d</span>
    bit set, using the newer facilities for error handling if desired.  Over time,
    old verbs written assuming the <span class="cmd">d</span> bit would not be set should be changed
    to use the new facilities instead.
</div>
<p>In addition to an owner and some permission bits, every verb has three
<em>argument specifiers</em>, one each for the <span class="cmd">direct object</span>, the <span class="cmd">preposition</span>, and
the <span class="cmd">indirect object</span>.  The direct and indirect specifiers are each drawn from
this set: <span class="cmd">this</span>, <span class="cmd">any</span>, or <span class="cmd">none</span>.  The preposition specifier
is <span class="cmd">none</span>, <span class="cmd">any</span>, or one of the items in this list:</p>
<ul>
    <li>with/using</li>
    <li>at/to</li>
    <li>in front of</li>
    <li>in/inside/into</li>
    <li>on top of/on/onto/upon</li>
    <li>out of/from inside/from</li>
    <li>over</li>
    <li>through</li>
    <li>under/underneath/beneath</li>
    <li>behind</li>
    <li>beside</li>
    <li>for/about</li>
    <li>is</li>
    <li>as</li>
    <li>off/off of</li>
</ul>

<p>The argument specifiers are used in the process of parsing commands,
described in the next chapter.</p>

<h2>The Built-in Command Parser</h2>
<p>The MOO server is able to do a small amount of parsing on the commands
that a player enters.  In particular, it can break apart commands that
follow one of the following forms:</p>
<ul>
    <li><var>verb</var></li>
    <li><var>verb</var> <var>direct-object</var></li>
    <li><var>verb</var> <var>direct-object</var> <var>preposition</var> <var>indirect-object</var></li>
</ul>

<p>Real examples of these forms, meaningful in the LambdaCore database, are
as follows:</p>
<pre>
look
take yellow bird
put yellow bird in cuckoo clock
</pre>
<p>Note that English articles (i.e., <span class="cmd">the</span>, <span class="cmd">a</span>, and <span class="cmd">an</span>) are not
generally used in MOO commands; the parser does not know that they are not important parts of objects' names.</p>
<p>To have any of this make real sense, it is important to understand precisely how the server decides what to do when a player types a
command.</p>
<p>First, the server checks whether or not the first non-blank character in the command is one of the following:
<ul>
    <li><span class="cmd"><var>"</var></li>
    <li><span class="cmd"><var>:</var></span></li>
    <li><span class="cmd"><var>;</var></span></li>
</ul>
<p>If so, that character is replaced by the corresponding command below, followed
by a space:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="cmd"><var>say</var></li>
    <li><span class="cmd"><var>emote</var></span></li>
    <li><span class="cmd"><var>eval</var></span></li>
</ul>
<p>For example this command:</p>
<div class="alert">
    <span class="cmd">"Hi, there.</span>
</div>
<p>will be treated exactly as if it were as follows:</p>
<div class="alert">
    <span class="cmd">say Hi, there.</span>
</div>
<p>The server next breaks up the command into words.  In the simplest case,
the command is broken into words at every run of space characters; for example,
the command <span class="cmd">foo bar baz</span> would be broken into the words <span class="cmd">foo</span>,
<span class="cmd">bar</span>, and <span class="cmd">baz</span>.  To force the server to include spaces in a
"word", all or part of a word can be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example, the command:</p>
<div class="alert">
    <span class="cmd">foo "bar mumble" baz" "fr"otz" bl"o"rt</span>
</div>
<p>is broken into the words <span class="cmd">foo</span>, <span class="cmd">bar mumble</span>, <span class="cmd">baz frotz</span>, and
<span class="cmd">blort</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, to include a double-quote or a backslash in a word,
they can be preceded by a backslash, just like in MOO strings.</p>
<p>Having thus broken the string into words, the server next checks to see if the
first word names any of the six "built-in" commands: 
<ul>
    <li><span class="cmd">.program</span></li>
    <li><span class="cmd">PREFIX</span></li>
    <li><span class="cmd">OUTPUTPREFIX</span></li>
    <li><span class="cmd">SUFFIX</span></li>
    <li><span class="cmd">OUTPUTSUFFIX</span></li>
    <li>or the connection's defined <em>flush</em> command, if any (<span class="cmd">.flush</span> by default).</li>
</ul>
<p>The first one of these is only available to programmers, the next four are
intended for use by client programs, and the last can vary from database to
database or even connection to connection; all six are described in the final
chapter of this document, "Server Commands and Database Assumptions".  If the
first word isn't one of the above, then we get to the usual case: a normal MOO
command.</p>
<p>The server next gives code in the database a chance to handle the command.  If
the verb <span class="cmd">$do_command()</span> exists, it is called with the words of the
command passed as its arguments and <span class="cmd">argstr</span> set to the raw command typed
by the user.  If <span class="cmd">$do_command()</span> does not exist, or if that verb-call
completes normally (i.e., without suspending or aborting) and returns a false
value, then the built-in command parser is invoked to handle the command as
described below.  Otherwise, it is assumed that the database code handled the
command completely and no further action is taken by the server for that
command.</p>
<p>If the built-in command parser is invoked, the server tries to parse the
command into a verb, direct object, preposition and indirect object.  The first
word is taken to be the verb.  The server then tries to find one of the
prepositional phrases listed at the end of the previous section, using the
match that occurs earliest in the command.  For example, in the very odd
command <span class="cmd">foo as bar to baz</span>, the server would take <span class="cmd">as</span> as the
preposition, not <span class="cmd">to</span>.</p>
<p>If the server succeeds in finding a preposition, it considers the words
between the verb and the preposition to be the direct object and those
after the preposition to be the indirect object.  In both cases, the
sequence of words is turned into a string by putting one space between
each pair of words.  Thus, in the odd command from the previous
paragraph, there are no words in the direct object (i.e., it is
considered to be the empty string, <span class="cmd">""</span>) and the indirect object is
<span class="cmd">"bar to baz"</span>.</p>
<p>If there was no preposition, then the direct object is taken to be all
of the words after the verb and the indirect object is the empty string.</p>
<p>The next step is to try to find MOO objects that are named by the direct
and indirect object strings.</p>
<p>First, if an object string is empty, then the corresponding object is the
special object <span class="cmd">#-1</span> (aka <span class="cmd">$nothing</span> in LambdaCore).  If an object
string has the form of an object number (i.e., a hash mark (<span class="cmd">#</span>) followed
by digits), and the object with that number exists, then that is the named
object.  If the object string is either <span class="cmd">"me"</span> or <span class="cmd">"here"</span>, then the
player object itself or its location is used, respectively.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    <p><span class="label label-info">Note:</span> $nothing is considered a <span class="cmd">corified</span> object.  
    This means that a <em>property</em> has been created on <span class="cmd">#0</span> named <span class="cmd">nothing</span> 
    with the value of <span class="cmd">#-1</span>.  For example (after creating the property): <span class="cmd">;#0.nothing = #-1</span></p>
    <p>This allows you to reference the <span class="cmd">#-1</span> object via it's corified reference of 
    <span class="cmd">$nothing</span>.  In practice this can be very useful as you can use corified references in your code (and should!) 
    instead of object numbers.</p>
    <p>Among other benefits this allows you to write your code (which references other objects) once and then swap out the 
    corified reference, pointing to a different object.</p>
    <p>For instance if you have a new errror logging system and you 
    want to replace the old $error_logger reference with your new one, you wont have to find all the references to the old 
    error logger object number in your code.  You can just change the property on <span class="cmd">#0</span> to reference the new object.</p>
</div>
<p>Otherwise, the server considers all of the objects whose location is either
the player (i.e., the objects the player is "holding", so to speak) or the
room the player is in (i.e., the objects in the same room as the player); it
will try to match the object string against the various names for these
objects.</p>
<p>The matching done by the server uses the <span class="cmd">aliases</span> property of each of the
objects it considers.  The value of this property should be a list of strings,
the various alternatives for naming the object.  If it is not a list, or the
object does not have an <span class="cmd">aliases</span> property, then the empty list is used.
In any case, the value of the <span class="cmd">name</span> property is added to the list for the
purposes of matching.</p>
<p>The server checks to see if the object string in the command is either exactly
equal to or a prefix of any alias; if there are any exact matches, the prefix
matches are ignored.  If exactly one of the objects being considered has a
matching alias, that object is used.  If more than one has a match, then the
special object <span class="cmd">#-2</span> (aka <span class="cmd">$ambiguous_match</span> in LambdaCore) is used.
If there are no matches, then the special object <span class="cmd">#-3</span> (aka
<span class="cmd">$failed_match</span> in LambdaCore) is used.</p>
<p>So, now the server has identified a verb string, a preposition string,
and direct- and indirect-object strings and objects.  It then looks at
each of the verbs defined on each of the following four objects, in
order:</p>
<ol>
    <li>the player who typed the command</li>
    <li>the room the player is in</li>
    <li>the direct object, if any</li>
    <li>the indirect object, if any.</li>
</ol>
<p>For each of these verbs in turn, it tests if all of the the following
are true:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the verb string in the command matches one of the names for the verb</li>
    <li>the direct- and indirect-object values found by matching are allowed by the corresponding <em>argument specifiers</em>
    for the verb</li>
    <li>the preposition string in the command is matched by the <em>preposition specifier</em> for the verb.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll explain each of these criteria in turn.</p>
<p>Every verb has one or more names; all of the names are kept in a single
string, separated by spaces.  In the simplest case, a verb-name is just
a word made up of any characters other than spaces and stars (i.e., ` '
and <span class="cmd">*</span>).  In this case, the verb-name matches only itself; that
is, the name must be matched exactly.</p>
<p>If the name contains a single star, however, then the name matches any prefix
of itself that is at least as long as the part before the star.  For example,
the verb-name <span class="cmd">foo*bar</span> matches any of the strings <span class="cmd">foo</span>,
<span class="cmd">foob</span>, <span class="cmd">fooba</span>, or <span class="cmd">foobar</span>; note that the star itself is not
considered part of the name.</p>
<p>If the verb name <em>ends</em> in a star, then it matches any string that begins
with the part before the star.  For example, the verb-name <span class="cmd">foo*</span> matches
any of the strings <span class="cmd">foo</span>, <span class="cmd">foobar</span>, <span class="cmd">food</span>, or <span class="cmd">foogleman</span>,
among many others.  As a special case, if the verb-name is <span class="cmd">*</span> (i.e., a
single star all by itself), then it matches anything at all.</p>
<p>Recall that the argument specifiers for the direct and indirect objects are
drawn from the set <span class="cmd">none</span>, <span class="cmd">any</span>, and <span class="cmd">this</span>.  If the specifier
is <span class="cmd">none</span>, then the corresponding object value must be <span class="cmd">#-1</span> (aka
<span class="cmd">$nothing</span> in LambdaCore); that is, it must not have been specified.  If
the specifier is <span class="cmd">any</span>, then the corresponding object value may be
anything at all.  Finally, if the specifier is <span class="cmd">this</span>, then the
corresponding object value must be the same as the object on which we found
this verb; for example, if we are considering verbs on the player, then the
object value must be the player object.</p>
<p>Finally, recall that the argument specifier for the preposition is
either <span class="cmd">none</span>, <span class="cmd">any</span>, or one of several sets of prepositional
phrases, given above.  A specifier of <span class="cmd">none</span> matches only if there
was no preposition found in the command.  A specifier of <span class="cmd">any</span>
always matches, regardless of what preposition was found, if any.  If
the specifier is a set of prepositional phrases, then the one found must
be in that set for the specifier to match.</p>
<p>So, the server considers several objects in turn, checking each of their
verbs in turn, looking for the first one that meets all of the criteria
just explained.  If it finds one, then that is the verb whose program
will be executed for this command.  If not, then it looks for a verb
named <span class="cmd">huh</span> on the room that the player is in; if one is found,
then that verb will be called.  This feature is useful for implementing
room-specific command parsing or error recovery.  If the server can't
even find a <span class="cmd">huh</span> verb to run, it prints an error message like
<span class="cmd">I couldn't understand that.</span> and the command is considered complete.</p>
<p>At long last, we have a program to run in response to the command typed by the
player.  When the code for the program begins execution, the following
built-in variables will have the indicated values:</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt>player</dt>
    <dd>an object, the player who typed the command</dd>
    <dt>this</dt>
    <dd>an object, the object on which this verb was found</dd>
    <dt>caller</dt>
    <dd>an object, the same as <span class="cmd">player</span></dd>
    <dt>verb</dt>
    <dd>a string, the first word of the command</dd>
    <dt>argstr</dt>
    <dd>a string, everything after the first word of the command</dd>
    <dt>args</dt>
    <dd>a list of strings, the words in <span class="cmd">argstr</span></dd>
    <dt>dobjstr</dt>
    <dd>a string, the direct object string found during parsing</dd>
    <dt>dobj</dt>
    <dd>an object, the direct object value found during matching</dd>
    <dt>prepstr</dt>
    <dd>a string, the prepositional phrase found during parsing</dd>
    <dt>iobjstr</dt>
    <dd>a string, the indirect object string</dd>
    <dt>iobj</dt>
    <dd>an object, the indirect object value</dd>
</dl>
<p>The value returned by the program, if any, is ignored by the server.</p>

<h2 id="the-moo-programming-language">The MOO Programming Language</h2>

</p>
<p>MOO stands for "MUD, Object Oriented."  MUD, in turn, has been said to stand
for many different things, but I tend to think of it as "Multi-User Dungeon"
in the spirit of those ancient precursors to MUDs, Adventure and Zork.</p>
<p>MOO, the programming language, is a relatively small and simple
object-oriented language designed to be easy to learn for most
non-programmers; most complex systems still require some significant
programming ability to accomplish, however.</p>
<p>Having given you enough context to allow you to understand exactly what MOO
code is doing, I now explain what MOO code looks like and what it means.  I
begin with the syntax and semantics of expressions, those pieces of code that
have values.  After that, I cover statements, the next level of structure up
from expressions.  Next, I discuss the concept of a task, the kind of running
process initiated by players entering commands, among other causes.  Finally,
I list all of the built-in functions available to MOO code and describe what
they do.</p>
<p>First, though, let me mention comments.  You can include bits of text in your
MOO program that are ignored by the server.  The idea is to allow you to put
in notes to yourself and others about what the code is doing.  To do this,
begin the text of the comment with the two characters <span class="cmd">/*</span> and end it
with the two characters <span class="cmd">*/</span>; this is just like comments in the C
programming language.  Note that the server will completely ignore that text;
it will <em>not</em> be saved in the database.  Thus, such comments are only
useful in files of code that you maintain outside the database.</p>
<p>To include a more persistent comment in your code, try using a character
string literal as a statement.  For example, the sentence about peanut butter
in the following code is essentially ignored during execution but will be
maintained in the database:</p>
<pre>
for x in (players())
  "Grendel eats peanut butter!";
  player:tell(x.name, " (", x, ")");
endfor
</pre>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">Note:</span> In practice, the only style of comments you will use is quoted strings of text.  Get used
    to it.
</div>
<h3 id="moo-language-expressions">MOO Language Expressions</h3>
<p>Expressions are those pieces of MOO code that generate values; for
example, the MOO code</p>
<pre>
3 + 4
</pre>
<p>is an expression that generates (or "has" or "returns") the value 7.
There are many kinds of expressions in MOO, all of them discussed below.</p>
<h4 id="errors-while_evaluating-expressions">Errors While Evaluating Expressions</h4>
<p>Most kinds of expressions can, under some circumstances, cause an error to be
generated.  For example, the expression <span class="cmd">x / y</span> will generate the error
<span class="cmd">E_DIV</span> if <span class="cmd">y</span> is equal to zero.  When an expression generates an
error, the behavior of the server is controlled by setting of the <span class="cmd">d</span>
(debug) bit on the verb containing that expression.  If the <span class="cmd">d</span> bit is not
set, then the error is effectively squelched immediately upon generation; the
error value is simply returned as the value of the expression that generated it.
<div class="well">
    <span class="label label-info">Note:</span> This error-squelching behavior is very error prone, since it
    affects <em>all</em> errors, including ones the programmer may not have
    anticipated.  The <span class="cmd">d</span> bit exists only for historical reasons; it was once
    the only way for MOO programmers to catch and handle errors.  The
    error-catching expression and the <span class="cmd">try</span>-<span class="cmd">except</span> statement, both
    described below, are far better ways of accomplishing the same thing.
</div>
<p>If the <span class="cmd">d</span> bit is set, as it usually is, then the error is <em>raised</em>
and can be caught and handled either by code surrounding the expression in
question or by verbs higher up on the chain of calls leading to the current
verb.  If the error is not caught, then the server aborts the entire task and,
by default, prints a message to the current player.  See the descriptions of
the error-catching expression and the <span class="cmd">try</span>-<span class="cmd">except</span> statement for
the details of how errors can be caught, and the chapter on server assumptions
about the database for details on the handling of uncaught errors.</p>
<h4 id="writing-values-directly-in-verbs">Writing Values Directly in Verbs</h4>
<p>The simplest kind of expression is a literal MOO value, just as
described in the section on values at the beginning of this document.
For example, the following are all expressions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>17</li>
    <li>#893</li>
    <li>"This is a character string."</li>
    <li>E_TYPE</li>
    <li>{"This", "is", "a", "list", "of", "words"}</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of lists, like the last example above, note that the list
expression contains other expressions, several character strings in this
case.  In general, those expressions can be of any kind at all, not
necessarily literal values.  For example,</p>
<pre>
{3 + 4, 3 - 4, 3 * 4}
</pre>
<p>is an expression whose value is the list <span class="cmd">{7, -1, 12}</span>.

<h4 id="naming-values-within-a-verb">Naming Values Within a Verb</h4>
<p>As discussed earlier, it is possible to store values in properties on
objects; the properties will keep those values forever, or until another
value is explicitly put there.  Quite often, though, it is useful to
have a place to put a value for just a little while.  MOO provides local
variables for this purpose.</p>
<p>Variables are named places to hold values; you can get and set the value
in a given variable as many times as you like.  Variables are temporary,
though; they only last while a particular verb is running; after it
finishes, all of the variables given values there cease to exist and the
values are forgotten.</p>
<p>Variables are also "local" to a particular verb; every verb has its own
set of them.  Thus, the variables set in one verb are not visible to the
code of other verbs.</p>
<p>The name for a variable is made up entirely of letters, digits, and the
underscore character (<span class="cmd">_</span>) and does not begin with a digit.  The
following are all valid variable names:</p>
<ul>
    <li>foo</li>
    <li>_foo</li>
    <li>this2that</li>
    <li>M68000</li>
    <li>two_words</li>
    <li>This_is_a_very_long_multiword_variable_name</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that, along with almost everything else in MOO, the case of the
letters in variable names is insignificant.  For example, these are all
names for the same variable:
<ul>
    <li>fubar</li>
    <li>Fubar</li>
    <li>FUBAR</li>
    <li>fUbAr</li>
</ul>
<p>A variable name is itself an expression; its value is the value of the named
variable.  When a verb begins, almost no variables have values yet; if you try
to use the value of a variable that doesn't have one, the error value
<span class="cmd">E_VARNF</span> is raised.  (MOO is unlike many other programming languages in
which one must <em>declare</em> each variable before using it; MOO has no such
declarations.)  The following variables always have values:</p>
<ul>
    <li>INT</li>
    <li>FLOAT</li>
    <li>OBJ</li>
    <li>STR</li>
    <li>LIST</li>
    <li>ERR</li>
    <li>player</li>
    <li>this</li>
    <li>caller</li>
    <li>verb</li>
    <li>args</li>

    <li>prepstr</li>
    <li>iobj</li>
    <li>iobjstr</li>
    <li>NUM</li>
</ul>
<p>The values of some of these variables always start out the same:</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt><span class="cmd">INT</span></dt>
    <dd>an integer, the type code for integers (see the description of the function <span class="cmd">typeof()</span>, below)</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">NUM</span></dt>
    <dd>the same as <span class="cmd">INT</span> (for historical reasons)</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">FLOAT</span></dt>
    <dd>an integer, the type code for floating-point numbers</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">LIST</span></dt>
    <dd>an integer, the type code for lists</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">STR</span></dt>
    <dd>an integer, the type code for strings</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">OBJ</span>
    <dd>an integer, the type code for objects</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">ERR</span></dt>
    <dd>an integer, the type code for error values</dd>
</dl>
<p>For others, the general meaning of the value is consistent, though the
value itself is different for different situations:</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt><span class="cmd">player</span></dt>
    <dd>an object, the player who typed the command that started the task that
    involved running this piece of code.</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">this</span></dt>
    <dd>an object, the object on which the currently-running verb was found.</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">caller</span></dt>
    <dd>an object, the object on which the verb that called the
    currently-running verb was found.  For the first verb called for a given
    command, <span class="cmd">caller</span> has the same value as <span class="cmd">player</span>.</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">verb</span></dt>
    <dd>a string, the name by which the currently-running verb was identified.</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">args</span></dt>
    <dd>a list, the arguments given to this verb.  For the first verb called for
    a given command, this is a list of strings, the words on the command
    line.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The rest of the so-called "built-in" variables are only really
meaningful for the first verb called for a given command.  Their
semantics is given in the discussion of command parsing, above.</p>
<p>To change what value is stored in a variable, use an <em>assignment</em>
expression:</p>
<pre>
<var>variable</var> = <var>expression</var>
</pre>
<p>For example, to change the variable named <span class="cmd">x</span> to have the value 17,
you would write <span class="cmd">x = 17</span> as an expression.  An assignment
expression does two things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>it changes the value of of the named variable</li>
    <li>it returns the new value of that variable</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the expression</p>
<pre>
13 + (x = 17)
</pre>
<p>changes the value of <span class="cmd">x</span> to be 17 and returns 30.</p>

<h4 id="arithmetic-operators">Arithmetic Operators</h4>
<p>All of the usual simple operations on numbers are available to MOO programs:</p>
<ul>
    <li>+</li>
    <li>-</li>
    <li>*</li>
    <li>/</li>
    <li>%</li>
</ul>
<p>These are, in order, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and
remainder.  In the following table, the expressions on the left have the
corresponding values on the right:</p>
<pre>
5 + 2       =>   7
5 - 2       =>   3
5 * 2       =>   10
5 / 2       =>   2
5.0 / 2.0   =>   2.5
5 % 2       =>   1
5.0 % 2.0   =>   1.0
5 % -2      =>   1
-5 % 2      =>   -1
-5 % -2     =>   -1
-(5 + 2)    =>   -7
</pre>
<p>Note that integer division in MOO throws away the remainder and that the result
of the remainder operator (<span class="cmd">%</span>) has the same sign as the left-hand
operand.  Also, note that <span class="cmd">-</span> can be used without a left-hand operand to
negate a numeric expression.</p>
<div class="well">
    <span class="label label-info">Fine point:</span> Integers and floating-point numbers cannot be mixed in any
    particular use of these arithmetic operators; unlike some other programming
    languages, MOO does not automatically coerce integers into floating-point
    numbers.  You can use the <span class="cmd">tofloat()</span> function to perform an explicit
    conversion.
</div>
<p>The <span class="cmd">+</span> operator can also be used to append two strings.  The expression <span class="cmd">"foo" + "bar"</span>
 has the value <span class="cmd">"foobar"</span></p>
 <p>Unless both operands to an arithmetic operator are numbers of the same kind
(or, for <span class="cmd">+</span>, both strings), the error value <span class="cmd">E_TYPE</span> is raised.  If
the right-hand operand for the division or remainder operators (<span class="cmd">/</span> or
<span class="cmd">%</span>) is zero, the error value <span class="cmd">E_DIV</span> is raised.</p>
<p>MOO also supports the exponentiation operation, also known as "raising to a
power," using the <span class="cmd">^</span> operator:</p>
<pre>
3 ^ 4       =>   81
3 ^ 4.5     error-->   E_TYPE
3.5 ^ 4     =>   150.0625
3.5 ^ 4.5   =>   280.741230801382
</pre>
<p>Note that if the first operand is an integer, then the second operand must also
be an integer.  If the first operand is a floating-point number, then the
second operand can be either kind of number.  Although it is legal to raise an
integer to a negative power, it is unlikely to be terribly useful.</p>
<h4 id="comparing-values">Comparing Values</h4>
<p>Any two values can be compared for equality using <span class="cmd">==</span> and
<span class="cmd">!=</span>.  The first of these returns 1 if the two values are equal and
0 otherwise; the second does the reverse:
<pre>
3 == 4                              =>  0
3 != 4                              =>  1
3 == 3.0                            =>  0
"foo" == "Foo"                      =>  1
#34 != #34                          =>  0
{1, #34, "foo"} == {1, #34, "FoO"}  =>  1
E_DIV == E_TYPE                     =>  0
3 != "foo"                          =>  1
</pre>
<p>Note that integers and floating-point numbers are never equal to one another,
even in the <em>obvious</em> cases.  Also note that comparison of strings (and list
values containing strings) is case-insensitive; that is, it does not
distinguish between the upper- and lower-case version of letters.  To test two
values for case-sensitive equality, use the <span class="cmd">equal</span> function described
later.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
    <span class="label label-warning">Warning:</span> It is easy (and very annoying) to confuse the
equality-testing operator (<span class="cmd">==</span>) with the assignment operator (<span class="cmd">=</span>),
leading to nasty, hard-to-find bugs.  Don't do this.
</div>
<p>Numbers, object numbers, strings, and error values can also be compared
for ordering purposes using the following operators:</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt>&#60;</dt>
    <dd>meaning "less than"</dd>
    <dt>&#60;=</dt>
    <dd>"less than or equal"</dd>
    <dt>&#62;=</dt>
    <dd>"greater than or equal"</dd>
    <dt>&#62;</dt>
    <dd>"greater than"</dd>
</ul>
<p>As with the equality
operators, these return 1 when their operands are in the appropriate relation and 0 otherwise:</p>
<pre>
3 &#60; 4           =>  1
3 &#60; 4.0         =>  E_TYPE (an error)
#34 &#62;= #32      =>  1
"foo" &#60;= "Boo"  =>  0
E_DIV &#62; E_TYPE  =>  1
</pre>
<p>Note that, as with the equality operators, strings are compared
case-insensitively.  To perform a case-sensitive string comparison, use the
<span class="cmd">strcmp</span> function described later.  Also note that the error values are
ordered as given in the table in the section on values.  If the operands to
these four comparison operators are of different types (even integers and
floating-point numbers are considered different types), or if they are lists,
then <span class="cmd">E_TYPE</span> is raised.</p>
<h4 id="values-as-true-or-false">Values as True and False</h4>
<p>There is a notion in MOO of <em>true</em> and <em>false</em> values; every value
is one or the other.  The true values are as follows:
<ul>
    <li>all integers other than zero</li>
    <li>all floating-point numbers not equal to <span class="cmd">0.0</span></li>
    <li>all non-empty strings (i.e., other than <span class="cmd">""</span>)</li>
    <li>all non-empty lists (i.e., other than <span class="cmd">{}</span>)</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
    <span class="label label-warning">Warning:</span> Negative numbers are considered true.
</div>
<p>All other values are false:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the integer zero</li>
    <li>the floating-point numbers <span class="cmd">0.0</span> and <span class="cmd">-0.0</span></li>
    <li>the empty string (<span class="cmd">""</span>)</li>
    <li>the empty list (<span class="cmd">{}</span>)</li>
    <li>all object numbers</li>
    <li>all error values</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">Note:</span> Objects are considered false.  If you need to evaluate if a value
    is of the type object, you can use <span class="cmd">typeof(potential_object) == OBJ</span> however, keep in mind
    that this does not mean that the object referenced actually exists.  IE: #100000000 will return true, but that does not
    mean that object exists in your MOO.
</div>
<p>There are four kinds of expressions and two kinds of statements that depend
upon this classification of MOO values.  In describing them, I sometimes refer
to the <em>truth value</em> of a MOO value; this is just <em>true</em> or
<em>false</em>, the category into which that MOO value is classified.</p>
<p>The conditional expression in MOO has the following form:
<pre>
<var>expression-1</var> ? <var>expression-2</var> | <var>expression-3</var>
</pre>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">Note:</span> This is commonly refered to as a ternary statement in most programming languages.
</div>
<p>First, <var>expression-1</var> is evaluated.  If it returns a true value, then
<var>expression-2</var> is evaluated and whatever it returns is returned as the
value of the conditional expression as a whole.  If <var>expression-1</var> returns
a false value, then <var>expression-3</var> is evaluated instead and its value is
used as that of the conditional expression.
<pre>
1 ? 2 | 3           =>  2
0 ? 2 | 3           =>  3
"foo" ? 17 | {#34}  =>  17
</pre>
<p>Note that only one of <var>expression-2</var> and <var>expression-3</var> is evaluated,
never both.</p>
<p>To negate the truth value of a MOO value, use the <span class="cmd">!</span> operator:</p>
<pre>
! <var>expression</var>
</pre>
<p>If the value of <var>expression</var> is true, <span class="cmd">!</span> returns 0; otherwise, it
returns 1:</p>
<pre>
! "foo"     =>  0
! (3 &#62;= 4)  =>  1
</pre>
<p>The negation operator is usually read as "not."</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">Note:</span> The "negation" or "not" operator is commonly referred to as "bang" by many
    programmers.
</div>
<p>It is frequently useful to test more than one condition to see if some or all
of them are true.  MOO provides two operators for this:</p>
<pre>
<var>expression-1</var> &#38;&#38; <var>expression-2</var>
<var>expression-1</var> || <var>expression-2</var>
</pre>
<p>These operators are usually read as "and" and "or," respectively.</p>
<p>The <span class="cmd">&#38;&#38;</span> operator first evaluates <var>expression-1</var>.  If it returns a
true value, then <var>expression-2</var> is evaluated and its value becomes the
value of the <span class="cmd">&#38;&#38;</span> expression as a whole; otherwise, the value of
<var>expression-1</var> is used as the value of the <span class="cmd">&#38;&#38;</span> expression.  
</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="alert alert-info">Note:</span> <var>expression-2</var> is only evaluated if <var>expression-1</var> returns a true
value.
</div>
<p> The <span class="cmd">&#38;&#38;</span> expression is equivalent to the conditional expression:</p>
<pre>
<var>expression-1</var> ? <var>expression-2</var> | <var>expression-1</var>
</pre>
<p>except that <var>expression-1</var> is only evaluated once.</p>
<p>The <span class="cmd">||</span> operator works similarly, except that <var>expression-2</var> is
evaluated only if <var>expression-1</var> returns a false value.  It is equivalent
to the conditional expression:
<pre>
<var>expression-1</var> ? <var>expression-1</var> | <var>expression-2</var>
</pre>
<p>except that, as with <span class="cmd">&#38;&#38;</span>, <var>expression-1</var> is only evaluated once.</p>
<p>These two operators behave very much like "and" and "or" in English:</p>
<pre>
1 &#38;&#38; 1                  =>  1
0 &#38;&#38; 1                  =>  0
0 &#38;&#38; 0                  =>  0
1 || 1                  =>  1
0 || 1                  =>  1
0 || 0                  =>  0
17 &#60;= 23  &#38;&#38;  23 &#60;= 27  =>  1
</pre>
<h4 id="indexing-into-lists-and-strings">Indexing into Lists and Strings</h4>
<p>Both strings and lists can be seen as ordered sequences of MOO values.  In the
case of strings, each is a sequence of single-character strings; that is, one
can view the string <span class="cmd">"bar"</span> as a sequence of the strings <span class="cmd">"b"</span>,
<span class="cmd">"a"</span>, and <span class="cmd">"r"</span>.  MOO allows you to refer to the elements of lists
and strings by number, by the <em>index</em> of that element in the list or
string.  The first element in a list or string has index 1, the second has
index 2, and so on.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
    <span class="alert alert-warning">Warning:</span> It is very important to note that unlike many programming
    languages (which use 0 as the starting index), MOO uses 1.
</div>

<h5 id="extracting-an-element-from-a-list-or-string">Extracting an Element from a List or String</h5>
<p>The indexing expression in MOO extracts a specified element from a list or string:</p>
<pre>
<var>expression-1</var>[<var>expression-2</var>]
</pre>
<p>First, <var>expression-1</var> is evaluated; it must return a list or a string (the
<em>sequence</em>).  Then, <var>expression-2</var> is evaluated and must return an
integer (the <em>index</em>).  If either of the expressions returns some other type
of value, <span class="cmd">E_TYPE</span> is returned.  The index must be between 1 and the
length of the sequence, inclusive; if it is not, then <span class="cmd">E_RANGE</span> is raised.
The value of the indexing expression is the index'th element in the sequence.
Anywhere within <var>expression-2</var>, you can use the symbol <span class="cmd">$</span> as an
expression returning the length of the value of <var>expression-1</var>.</p>
<pre>
"fob"[2]                =>  "o"
"fob"[1]                =>  "f"
{#12, #23, #34}[$ - 1]  =>  #23
</pre>
<p>Note that there are no legal indices for the empty string or list, since
there are no integers between 1 and 0 (the length of the empty string or
list).</p>
<div class="well">
    <span class="label label-info">Fine point:</span> The <span class="cmd">$</span> expression actually returns the length of the
    value of the expression just before the nearest enclosing <span class="cmd">[...]</span>
    indexing or subranging brackets.  For example:
<pre>
"frob"[{3, 2, 4}[$]]     =>  "b"
</pre>
    is possible because $ in this case represents the 3rd index of the list next to it, which evaluates to the value 4, 
    which in turn is applied as the index to the string, which evaluates to the b.
</div>
<h5 id="replacing-an-element-of-a-list-or-string">Replacing an Element of a List or String</h5>
<p>It often happens that one wants to change just one particular slot of a list or
string, which is stored in a variable or a property.  This can be done
conveniently using an <em>indexed assignment</em> having one of the following
forms:</p>
<pre>
<var>variable</var>[<var>index-expr</var>] = <var>result-expr</var>
<var>object-expr</var>.<var>name</var>[<var>index-expr</var>] = <var>result-expr</var>
<var>object-expr</var>.(<var>name-expr</var>)[<var>index-expr</var>] = <var>result-expr</var>
$<var>name</var>[<var>index-expr</var>] = <var>result-expr</var>
</pre>
<p>The first form writes into a variable, and the last three forms write into a
property.  The usual errors (<span class="cmd">E_TYPE</span>, <span class="cmd">E_INVIND</span>, <span class="cmd">E_PROPNF</span>
and <span class="cmd">E_PERM</span> for lack of read/write permission on the property) may be
raised, just as in reading and writing any object property; see the
discussion of object property expressions below for details.</p>

<p>Correspondingly, if <var>variable</var> does not yet have a value (i.e., it has never been assigned
to), <span class="cmd">E_VARNF</span> will be raised.</p>
<p>If <var>index-expr</var> is not an integer, or if the value of <var>variable</var> or the
property is not a list or string, <span class="cmd">E_TYPE</span> is raised.  If
<var>result-expr</var> is a string, but not of length 1, <span class="cmd">E_INVARG</span> is
raised.  Now suppose <var>index-expr</var> evaluates to an integer <var>n</var>.  If
<var>n</var> is outside the range of the list or string (i.e.  smaller than 1 or
greater than the length of the list or string), <span class="cmd">E_RANGE</span> is raised.
Otherwise, the actual assignment takes place.</p>
<p>For lists, the variable or the
property is assigned a new list that is identical to the original one except at
the <var>n</var>-th position, where the new list contains the result of
<var>result-expr</var> instead.  For strings, the variable or the property is
assigned a new string that is identical to the original one, except the
<var>n</var>-th character is changed to be <var>result-expr</var>.</p>
<p>The assignment expression itself returns the value of <var>result-expr</var>.  For
the following examples, assume that <span class="cmd">l</span> initially contains the list
<span class="cmd">{1, 2, 3}</span> and that <span class="cmd">s</span> initially contains the string "foobar":</p>
<pre>
l[5] = 3          =>   E_RANGE (error)
l["first"] = 4    =>   E_TYPE  (error)
s[3] = "baz"      =>   E_INVARG (error)
l[2] = l[2] + 3   =>   5
l                 =>   {1, 5, 3}
l[2] = "foo"      =>   "foo"
l                 =>   {1, "foo", 3}
s[2] = "u"        =>   "u"
s                 =>   "fuobar"
s[$] = "z"        =>   "z"
s                 =>   "fuobaz"
</pre>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">Note:</span> (error) is only used for formatting and identification purposes in these examples and is not present
    in an actual raised error on the MOO.
</div>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">Note:</span> The <span class="cmd">$</span> expression may also be used in indexed assignments with
    the same meaning as before.
</div>
<div class="well">
    <span class="label label-info">Fine point:</span> After an indexed assignment, the variable or property

    jargon, the original list is not mutated, and there is no aliasing.  (Indeed,
    no MOO value is mutable and no aliasing ever occurs.)
</div>
<p>In the list case, indexed assignment can be nested to many levels, to work on
nested lists.  Assume that <span class="cmd">l</span> initially contains the list:</p>
<pre>
{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, "foo"}
</pre>
<p>in the following examples:</p>
<pre>
l[7] = 4             =>   E_RANGE (error)
l[1][8] = 35         =>   E_RANGE (error)
l[3][2] = 7          =>   E_TYPE (error)
l[1][1][1] = 3       =>   E_TYPE (error)
l[2][2] = -l[2][2]   =>   -5
l                    =>   {{1, 2, 3}, {4, -5, 6}, "foo"}
l[2] = "bar"         =>   "bar"
l                    =>   {{1, 2, 3}, "bar", "foo"}
l[2][$] = "z"        =>   "z"
l                    =>   {{1, 2, 3}, "baz", "foo"}
</pre>
<p>The first two examples raise <span class="cmd">E_RANGE</span> because 7 is out of the range of
<span class="cmd">l</span> and 8 is out of the range of <span class="cmd">l[1]</span>.  The next two examples
raise <span class="cmd">E_TYPE</span> because <span class="cmd">l[3]</span> and <span class="cmd">l[1][1]</span> are not lists.</p>

<h5 id="extracting-a-subsequence-of-a-list-or-string">Extracting a Subsequence of a List or String</h5>
<p>The range expression extracts a specified subsequence from a list or string:</p>
<pre>
<var>expression-1</var>[<var>expression-2</var>..<var>expression-3</var>]
</pre>
<p>The three expressions are evaluated in order.  <var>Expression-1</var> must return a
list or string (the <em>sequence</em>) and the other two expressions must return
integers (the <em>low</em> and <em>high</em> indices, respectively); otherwise,

<p>If the low index is greater than the high index, then the empty string or list
is returned, depending on whether the sequence is a string or a list.
Otherwise, both indices must be between 1 and the length of the sequence;
<span class="cmd">E_RANGE</span> is raised if they are not.  A new list or string is returned
that contains just the elements of the sequence with indices between the low
and high bounds.</p>
<pre>
"foobar"[2..$]                       =>  "oobar"
"foobar"[3..3]                       =>  "o"

<h5 id="replacing-a-subsequence-of-a-list-or-string">Replacing a Subsequence of a List or String</h5>
<p>The subrange assigment replaces a specified subsequence of a list or string
with a supplied subsequence.  The allowed forms are:</p>
<pre>
<var>variable</var>[<var>start-index-expr</var>..<var>end-index-expr</var>] = <var>result-expr</var>
<var>object-expr</var>.<var>name</var>[<var>start-index-expr</var>..<var>end-index-expr</var>] = <var>result-expr</var>
<var>object-expr</var>.(<var>name-expr</var>)[<var>start-index-expr</var>..<var>end-index-expr</var>] = <var>result-expr</var>
$<var>name</var>[<var>start-index-expr</var>..<var>end-index-expr</var>] = <var>result-expr</var>
</pre>
<p>As with indexed assigments, the first form writes into a variable, and the last
three forms write into a property.  The same errors (<span class="cmd">E_TYPE</span>,
<span class="cmd">E_INVIND</span>, <span class="cmd">E_PROPNF</span> and <span class="cmd">E_PERM</span> for lack of read/write
permission on the property) may be raised.  If <var>variable</var> does not yet have
a value (i.e., it has never been assigned to), <span class="cmd">E_VARNF</span> will be raised.</p>
<p>As before, the <span class="cmd">$</span> expression can be used in either <var>start-index-expr</var>
or <var>end-index-expr</var>, meaning the length of the original value of the
expression just before the <span class="cmd">[...]</span> part.</p>
<p>If <var>start-index-expr</var> or <var>end-index-expr</var> is not an integer, if the value
of <var>variable</var> or the property is not a list or string, or <var>result-expr</var>
is not the same type as <var>variable</var> or the property, <span class="cmd">E_TYPE</span> is
raised.  <span class="cmd">E_RANGE</span> is raised if <var>end-index-expr</var> is less than zero
or if <var>start-index-expr</var> is greater than the length of the list or string
plus one.  Note: the length of <var>result-expr</var> does not need to be the same
as the length of the specified range.</p>
<p>In precise terms, the subrange assigment</p>
<pre>
<var>v</var>[<var>start</var>..<var>end</var>] = <var>value</var>
</pre>
<p>is equivalent to</p>
<pre>
<var>v</var> = {@<var>v</var>[1..<var>start</var> - 1], @<var>value</var>, @<var>v</var>[<var>end</var> + 1..$]}
</pre>
<p>if <var>v</var> is a list and to</p>
<pre>
<var>v</var> = <var>v</var>[1..<var>start</var> - 1] + <var>value</var> + <var>v</var>[<var>end</var> + 1..$]
</pre>
<p>if <var>v</var> is a string.  The assigment expression itself returns the value of <var>result-expr</var>.</p>

s                      =>   "testfubarbaz"
</pre>
<h4 id="other-operations-on-lists">Other Operations on Lists</h4>
<p>As was mentioned earlier, lists can be constructed by writing a
comma-separated sequence of expressions inside curly braces:</p>
<pre>
{<var>expression-1</var>, <var>expression-2</var>, ..., <var>expression-N</var>}
</pre>
<p>The resulting list has the value of <var>expression-1</var> as its first element,
that of <var>expression-2</var> as the second, etc.
<pre>
{3 &#60; 4, 3 &#60;= 4, 3 &#62;= 4, 3 &#62; 4}  =>  {1, 1, 0, 0}
</pre>
<p>Additionally, one may precede any of these expressions by the splicing
operator, <span class="cmd">@</span>.  Such an expression must return a list; rather than the
old list itself becoming an element of the new list, all of the elements of
the old list are included in the new list.  This concept is easy to
understand, but hard to explain in words, so here are some examples.  For
these examples, assume that the variable <span class="cmd">a</span> has the value <span class="cmd">{2, 3,
4}</span> and that <span class="cmd">b</span> has the value <span class="cmd">{"Foo", "Bar"}</span>:</p>
<pre>
{1, a, 5}   =>  {1, {2, 3, 4}, 5}
{1, @a, 5}  =>  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
{a, @a}     =>  {{2, 3, 4}, 2, 3, 4}
{@a, @b}    =>  {2, 3, 4, "Foo", "Bar"}
</pre>
<p>If the splicing operator (<span class="cmd">@</span>) precedes an expression whose value
is not a list, then <span class="cmd">E_TYPE</span> is raised as the value of the list
construction as a whole.</p>
<p>The list membership expression tests whether or not a given MOO value is an
element of a given list and, if so, with what index:</p>
<pre>
<var>expression-1</var> in <var>expression-2</var>
</pre>
<p><var>Expression-2</var> must return a list; otherwise, <span class="cmd">E_TYPE</span> is raised.
If the value of <var>expression-1</var> is in that list, then the index of its first
occurrence in the list is returned; otherwise, the <span class="cmd">in</span> expression returns
0.</p>
<pre>
2 in {5, 8, 2, 3}               =>  3
7 in {5, 8, 2, 3}               =>  0
"bar" in {"Foo", "Bar", "Baz"}  =>  2
</pre>
<p>Note that the list membership operator is case-insensitive in comparing
strings, just like the comparison operators.  To perform a case-sensitive list
membership test, use the <span class="cmd">is_member</span> function described later.  Note also
that since it returns zero only if the given value is not in the given list,
the <span class="cmd">in</span> expression can be used either as a membership test or as an
element locator.</p>

<h4 id="spreading-list-elements-among-variables">Spreading List Elements Among Variables</h4>
<p>It is often the case in MOO programming that you will want to access the
elements of a list individually, with each element stored in a separate
variables.  This desire arises, for example, at the beginning of almost every
MOO verb, since the arguments to all verbs are delivered all bunched together
in a single list.  In such circumstances, you <em>could</em> write statements
like these:</p>
<pre>
first = args[1];
second = args[2];
if (length(args) &#62; 2)
  third = args[3];
else
  third = 0;
endif
</pre>
<p>This approach gets pretty tedious, both to read and to write, and it's prone to
errors if you mistype one of the indices.  Also, you often want to check
whether or not any <em>extra</em> list elements were present, adding to the
tedium.</p>
<p>MOO provides a special kind of assignment expression, called <em>scattering
assignment</em> made just for cases such as these.  A scattering assignment
expression looks like this:</p>
<pre>
{<var>target</var>, ...} = <var>expr</var>
</pre>
<p>where each <var>target</var> describes a place to store elements of the list that
results from evaluating <var>expr</var>.  A <var>target</var> has one of the following
forms:</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt><span class="cmd"><var>variable</var></span></dt>
    <dd>This is the simplest target, just a simple variable; the list element in the
    corresponding position is assigned to the variable.  This is called a
    <em>required</em> target, since the assignment is required to put one of the list
    elements into the variable.</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">?<var>variable</var></span></dt>
    <dd>This is called an <em>optional</em> target, since it doesn't always get assigned
    an element.  If there are any list elements left over after all of the required
    targets have been accounted for (along with all of the other optionals to the
    left of this one), then this variable is treated like a required one and the
    list element in the corresponding position is assigned to the variable.  If
    there aren't enough elements to assign one to this target, then no assignment
    is made to this variable, leaving it with whatever its previous value was.</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">?<var>variable</var> = <var>default-expr</var></span></dt>
    <dd>This is also an optional target, but if there aren't enough list elements
    available to assign one to this target, the result of evaluating
    <var>default-expr</var> is assigned to it instead.  Thus, <var>default-expr</var>
    provides a <em>default value</em> for the variable.  The default value expressions
    are evaluated and assigned working from left to right <em>after</em> all of the
    other assignments have been performed.</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">@<var>variable</var></span></dt>
    <dd>By analogy with the <span class="cmd">@</span> syntax in list construction, this variable is
    assigned a list of all of the `leftover' list elements in this part of the list
    after all of the other targets have been filled in.  It is assigned the empty
    list if there aren't any elements left over.  This is called a <em>rest</em>
    target, since it gets the rest of the elements.  There may be at most one rest
    target in each scattering assignment expression.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If there aren't enough list elements to fill all of the required targets, or if
there are more than enough to fill all of the required and optional targets but
there isn't a rest target to take the leftover ones, then <span class="cmd">E_ARGS</span> is
raised.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how this works.  Assume first that the verb
<span class="cmd">me:foo()</span> contains the following code:</p>
<pre>
b = c = e = 17;
{a, ?b, ?c = 8, @d, ?e = 9, f} = args;
return {a, b, c, d, e, f};
</pre>

<p>Then the following calls return the given values:</p>
<pre>
me:foo(1)                        =>   E_ARGS (error)
me:foo(1, 2)                     =>   {1, 17, 8, {}, 9, 2}
me:foo(1, 2, 3)                  =>   {1, 2, 8, {}, 9, 3}
me:foo(1, 2, 3, 4)               =>   {1, 2, 3, {}, 9, 4}
me:foo(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)            =>   {1, 2, 3, {}, 4, 5}
me:foo(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)         =>   {1, 2, 3, {4}, 5, 6}
me:foo(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)      =>   {1, 2, 3, {4, 5}, 6, 7}
me:foo(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)   =>   {1, 2, 3, {4, 5, 6}, 7, 8}
</pre>
<p>Using scattering assignment, the example at the begining of this section could
be rewritten more simply, reliably, and readably:</p>
<pre>
{first, second, ?third = 0} = args;
</pre>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">Fine point:</span> It is good MOO programming style to use a scattering assignment at the top of
    nearly every verb, since it shows so clearly just what kinds of arguments the verb expects.
</div>
<h4 id="getting-and-setting-the-values-of-properties">Getting and Setting the Values of Properties</h4>
<p>Usually, one can read the value of a property on an object with a simple
expression:</p>
<pre>
<var>expression</var>.<var>name</var>
</pre>
<p><var>Expression</var> must return an object number; if not, <span class="cmd">E_TYPE</span> is
raised.  If the object with that number does not exist, <span class="cmd">E_INVIND</span> is
raised.  Otherwise, if the object does not have a property with that name,
then <span class="cmd">E_PROPNF</span> is raised.  Otherwise, if the named property is not
readable by the owner of the current verb, then <span class="cmd">E_PERM</span> is raised.
Finally, assuming that none of these terrible things happens, the value of the
named property on the given object is returned.</p>
<p>I said "usually" in the paragraph above because that simple expression only
works if the name of the property obeys the same rules as for the names of
variables (i.e., consists entirely of letters, digits, and underscores, and
doesn't begin with a digit).  Property names are not restricted to this set,
though.  Also, it is sometimes useful to be able to figure out what property
to read by some computation.  For these more general uses, the following
syntax is also allowed:</p>
<pre>
<var>expression-1</var>.(<var>expression-2</var>)
</pre>
<p>As before, <var>expression-1</var> must return an object number.  <var>Expression-2</var>
must return a string, the name of the property to be read; <span class="cmd">E_TYPE</span>
is raised otherwise.  Using this syntax, any property can be read,
regardless of its name.</p>
<p>Note that, as with almost everything in MOO, case is not significant in the
names of properties.  Thus, the following expressions are all equivalent:</p>
<pre>
foo.bar
foo.Bar
foo.("bAr")
</pre>
<p>The LambdaCore database uses several properties on <span class="cmd">#0</span>, the <em>system
object</em>, for various special purposes.  For example, the value of
<span class="cmd">#0.room</span> is the "generic room" object, <span class="cmd">#0.exit</span> is the "generic
exit" object, etc.  This allows MOO programs to refer to these useful objects
more easily (and more readably) than using their object numbers directly.  To
make this usage even easier and more readable, the expression</p>
<pre>
$<var>name</var>
</pre>
<p>(where <var>name</var> obeys the rules for variable names) is an abbreviation for</p>
<pre>
#0.<var>name</var>
</pre>
<p>Thus, for example, the value <span class="cmd">$nothing</span> mentioned earlier is really
<span class="cmd">#-1</span>, the value of <span class="cmd">#0.nothing</span>.</p>
<p>As with variables, one uses the assignment operator (<span class="cmd">=</span>) to change the
value of a property.  For example, the expression</p>
<pre>
14 + (#27.foo = 17)
</pre>
<p>changes the value of the <span class="cmd">foo</span> property of the object numbered 27 to be
17 and then returns 31.  Assignments to properties check that the owner of the
current verb has write permission on the given property, raising
<span class="cmd">E_PERM</span> otherwise.  Read permission is not required.</p>

<h4 id="calling-built-in-functions-and-other-verbs">Calling Built-in Functions and Other Verbs</h4>
<p>MOO provides a large number of useful functions for performing a wide
variety of operations; a complete list, giving their names, arguments,
and semantics, appears in a separate section later.  As an example to
give you the idea, there is a function named <span class="cmd">length</span> that returns
the length of a given string or list.</p>
<p>The syntax of a call to a function is as follows:</p>
<pre>
<var>name</var>(<var>expr-1</var>, <var>expr-2</var>, ..., <var>expr-N</var>)
</pre>
<p>where <var>name</var> is the name of one of the built-in functions.  The
expressions between the parentheses, called <em>arguments</em>, are each
evaluated in turn and then given to the named function to use in its
appropriate way.  Most functions require that a specific number of arguments
be given; otherwise, <span class="cmd">E_ARGS</span> is raised.  Most also require that
certain of the arguments have certain specified types (e.g., the
<span class="cmd">length()</span> function requires a list or a string as its argument);
<span class="cmd">E_TYPE</span> is raised if any argument has the wrong type.</p>
<p>As with list construction, the splicing operator <span class="cmd">@</span> can precede
any argument expression.  The value of such an expression must be a
list; <span class="cmd">E_TYPE</span> is raised otherwise.  The elements of this list
are passed as individual arguments, in place of the list as a whole.</p>
<p>Verbs can also call other verbs, usually using this syntax:</p>
<pre>
<var>expr-0</var>:<var>name</var>(<var>expr-1</var>, <var>expr-2</var>, ..., <var>expr-N</var>)
</pre>
<p><var>Expr-0</var> must return an object number; <span class="cmd">E_TYPE</span> is raised otherwise.
If the object with that number does not exist, <span class="cmd">E_INVIND</span> is raised.  If
this task is too deeply nested in verbs calling verbs calling verbs, then
<span class="cmd">E_MAXREC</span> is raised; the default limit is 50 levels, but this can be
changed from within the database; see the chapter on server assumptions about
the database for details.  If neither the object nor any of its ancestors
defines a verb matching the given name, <span class="cmd">E_VERBNF</span> is raised.
Otherwise, if none of these nasty things happens, the named verb on the given
object is called; the various built-in variables have the following initial
values in the called verb:</p>

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt><span class="cmd">this</span></dt>
    <dd>an object, the value of <var>expr-0</var></dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">verb</span></dt>
    <dd>a string, the <var>name</var> used in calling this verb</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">args</span></dt>
    <dd>a list, the values of <var>expr-1</var>, <var>expr-2</var>, etc.</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">caller</span></dt>
    <dd>an object, the value of <span class="cmd">this</span> in the calling verb</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">player</span></dt>
    <dd>an object, the same value as it had initially in the calling verb or, if the
    calling verb is running with wizard permissions, the same as the current value
    in the calling verb.</dd>
</dl>
<p>All other built-in variables (<span class="cmd">argstr</span>, <span class="cmd">dobj</span>, etc.) are initialized
with the same values they have in the calling verb.</p>
<p>As with the discussion of property references above, I said "usually" at the
beginning of the previous paragraph because that syntax is only allowed when
the <var>name</var> follows the rules for allowed variable names.  Also as with
property reference, there is a syntax allowing you to compute the name of the
verb:</p>
<pre>
<var>expr-0</var>:(<var>expr-00</var>)(<var>expr-1</var>, <var>expr-2</var>, ..., <var>expr-N</var>)
</pre>
<p>The expression <var>expr-00</var> must return a string; <span class="cmd">E_TYPE</span> is raised
otherwise.</p>
<p>The splicing operator (<span class="cmd">@</span>) can be used with verb-call arguments,
too, just as with the arguments to built-in functions.</p>
<p>In many databases, a number of important verbs are defined on <span class="cmd">#0</span>, the
<em>system object</em>.  As with the <span class="cmd">$foo</span> notation for properties on
<span class="cmd">#0</span>, the server defines a special syntax for calling verbs on <span class="cmd">#0</span>:</p>
<pre>
$<var>name</var>(<var>expr-1</var>, <var>expr-2</var>, ..., <var>expr-N</var>)
</pre>
<p>(where <var>name</var> obeys the rules for variable names) is an abbreviation for</p>
<pre>
#0:<var>name</var>(<var>expr-1</var>, <var>expr-2</var>, ..., <var>expr-N</var>)
</pre>
<h4 id="catching-errors-in-expressions">Catching Errors in Expressions</h4>
<p>It is often useful to be able to <em>catch</em> an error that an expression
raises, to keep the error from aborting the whole task, and to keep on running
as if the expression had returned some other value normally.  The following
expression accomplishes this:</p>
<pre>
` <var>expr-1</var> ! <var>codes</var> =&#62; <var>expr-2</var> '
</pre>
<div class="well">
    <span class="label label-info">Note:</span> The open- and close-quotation marks in the previous line are
    really part of the syntax; you must actually type them as part of your MOO program for this kind of expression.
</div>
<p>The <var>codes</var> part is either the keyword <span class="cmd">ANY</span> or else a
comma-separated list of expressions, just like an argument list.  As in an
argument list, the splicing operator (<span class="cmd">@</span>) can be used here.  The
<span class="cmd">=&#62; <var>expr-2</var></span> part of the error-catching expression is optional.</p>
<p>First, the <var>codes</var> part is evaluated, yielding a list of error codes that
should be caught if they're raised; if <var>codes</var> is <span class="cmd">ANY</span>, then it is
equivalent to the list of all possible MOO values.</p>
<p>Next, <var>expr-1</var> is evaluated.  If it evaluates normally, without raising an
error, then its value becomes the value of the entire error-catching
expression.  If evaluating <var>expr-1</var> results in an error being raised, then
call that error <var>E</var>.  If <var>E</var> is in the list resulting from evaluating
<var>codes</var>, then <var>E</var> is considered <em>caught</em> by this error-catching
expression.  In such a case, if <var>expr-2</var> was given, it is evaluated to get
the outcome of the entire error-catching expression; if <var>expr-2</var> was
omitted, then <var>E</var> becomes the value of the entire expression.  If <var>E</var>
is <em>not</em> in the list resulting from <var>codes</var>, then this expression does
not catch the error at all and it continues to be raised, possibly to be caught
by some piece of code either surrounding this expression or higher up on the
verb-call stack.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of the use of this kind of expression:</p>
<pre>
`x + 1 ! E_TYPE =&#62; 0'
</pre>
<p>Returns <span class="cmd">x + 1</span> if <span class="cmd">x</span> is an integer, returns <span class="cmd">0</span> if <span class="cmd">x</span> is
not an integer, and raises <span class="cmd">E_VARNF</span> if <span class="cmd">x</span> doesn't have a value.</p>
<pre>
`x.y ! E_PROPNF, E_PERM =&#62; 17'
</pre>
<p>Returns <span class="cmd">x.y</span> if that doesn't cause an error, <span class="cmd">17</span> if <span class="cmd">x</span>
doesn't have a <span class="cmd">y</span> property or that property isn't readable, and raises
some other kind of error (like <span class="cmd">E_INVIND</span>) if <span class="cmd">x.y</span> does.</p>
<pre>
`1 / 0 ! ANY'
</pre>
<p>Returns <span class="cmd">E_DIV</span>.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">Note:</span> It's important to mention how powerful this compact syntax for writing error catching code can be.
    When used properly you can write very complex and elegant code. For example imagine that you have a set of objects from different parents,
    some of which define a specific verb, and some of which do not.  If for instance, your code wants to perform some function <em>if</em> the
    verb exists, you can write `obj:verbname() ! ANY => 0' to allow the MOO to attempt to execute that verb and then if it fails, catch the error
    and continue operations normally.  
</div>
<h4 id="parentheses-and-operator-precedence">Parentheses and Operator Precedence</h4>
<p>As shown in a few examples above, MOO allows you to use parentheses to make it
clear how you intend for complex expressions to be grouped.  For example, the
expression</p>
<pre>
3 * (4 + 5)
</pre>
<p>performs the addition of 4 and 5 before multiplying the result by 3.</p>
<p>If you leave out the parentheses, MOO will figure out how to group the
expression according to certain rules.  The first of these is that some
operators have higher <em>precedence</em> than others; operators with higher
precedence will more tightly bind to their operands than those with lower
precedence.  For example, multiplication has higher precedence than addition;
thus, if the parentheses had been left out of the expression in the previous
paragraph, MOO would have grouped it as follows:</p>
<pre>
(3 * 4) + 5
</pre>
<p>The table below gives the relative precedence of all of the MOO
operators; operators on higher lines in the table have higher precedence
and those on the same line have identical precedence:</p>
<pre>
!       - (without a left operand)
^
*       /       %
+       -
==      !=      &#60;       &#60;=      &#62;       &#62;=      in
&#38;&#38;      ||
... ? ... | ... (the conditional expression)
=
</pre>
<p>Thus, the horrendous expression</p>
<pre>
x = a &#60; b &#38;&#38; c &#62; d + e * f ? w in y | - q - r
</pre>
<p>would be grouped as follows:</p>
<pre>
x = (((a &#60; b) &#38;&#38; (c &#62; (d + (e * f)))) ? (w in y) | ((- q) - r))
</pre>
<p>It is best to keep expressions simpler than this and to use parentheses
liberally to make your meaning clear to other humans.</p>

<h3 id="moo-langauge-statements">MOO Language Statements</h3>
<p>Statements are MOO constructs that, in contrast to expressions, perform some
useful, non-value-producing operation.  For example, there are several kinds of
statements, called <em>looping constructs</em>, that repeatedly perform some set of
operations.  Fortunately, there are many fewer kinds of statements in MOO than
there are kinds of expressions.</p>

<h4 id="errors-while-executing-statements">Errors While Executing Statements</h4>
<p>Statements do not return values, but some kinds of statements can, under
certain circumstances described below, generate errors.  If such an error is
generated in a verb whose <span class="cmd">d</span> (debug) bit is not set, then the error is
ignored and the statement that generated it is simply skipped; execution
proceeds with the next statement.</p>
<div class="well">
    <span class="label label-info">Note:</span> This error-ignoring behavior is very error prone, since it
    affects <em>all</em> errors, including ones the programmer may not have
    anticipated.  The <span class="cmd">d</span> bit exists only for historical reasons; it was once
    the only way for MOO programmers to catch and handle errors.  The
    error-catching expression and the <span class="cmd">try</span>-<span class="cmd">except</span> statement are far
    better ways of accomplishing the same thing.
</div>
<p>If the <span class="cmd">d</span> bit is set, as it usually is, then the error is <em>raised</em>
and can be caught and handled either by code surrounding the expression in
question or by verbs higher up on the chain of calls leading to the current
verb.  If the error is not caught, then the server aborts the entire task and,
by default, prints a message to the current player.  See the descriptions of
the error-catching expression and the <span class="cmd">try</span>-<span class="cmd">except</span> statement for
the details of how errors can be caught, and the chapter on server assumptions
about the database for details on the handling of uncaught errors.</p>

<h4 id="simple-statements">Simple Statements</h4>
<p>The simplest kind of statement is the <em>null</em> statement, consisting of just
a semicolon:</p>
<pre>
;
</pre>
<p>It doesn't do anything at all, but it does it very quickly.</p>
<p>The next simplest statement is also one of the most common, the expression
statement, consisting of any expression followed by a semicolon:</p>
<pre>
<var>expression</var>;
</pre>
<p>The given expression is evaluated and the resulting value is ignored.
Commonly-used kinds of expressions for such statements include
assignments and verb calls.  Of course, there's no use for such a
statement unless the evaluation of <var>expression</var> has some side-effect,
such as changing the value of some variable or property, printing some
text on someone's screen, etc.</p>
<pre>
#42.weight = 40;
#42.weight;
2 + 5;
obj:verbname();
1 &gt; 2;
2 &lt; 1;
</pre>
<h4 id="statements-for-testing-conditionals">Statements for Testing Conditions</h4>
<p>The <span class="cmd">if</span> statement allows you to decide whether or not to perform some
statements based on the value of an arbitrary expression:</p>
<pre>
if (<var>expression</var>)
  <var>statements</var>
endif
</pre>
<p><var>Expression</var> is evaluated and, if it returns a true value, the statements
are executed in order; otherwise, nothing more is done.</p>
<p>One frequently wants to perform one set of statements if some condition is
true and some other set of statements otherwise.  The optional <span class="cmd">else</span>
phrase in an <span class="cmd">if</span> statement allows you to do this:</p>
<pre>
if (<var>expression</var>)
  <var>statements-1</var>
else
  <var>statements-2</var>
endif
</pre>
<p>This statement is executed just like the previous one, except that
<var>statements-1</var> are executed if <var>expression</var> returns a true value and
<var>statements-2</var> are executed otherwise.</p>
<p>Sometimes, one needs to test several conditions in a kind of nested
fashion:</p>
<pre>
if (<var>expression-1</var>)
  <var>statements-1</var>
else
  if (<var>expression-2</var>)
    <var>statements-2</var>
  else
    if (<var>expression-3</var>)
      <var>statements-3</var>
    else
      <var>statements-4</var>
    endif
  endif
endif
</pre>
<p>Such code can easily become tedious to write and difficult to read.  MOO
provides a somewhat simpler notation for such cases:</p>
<pre>
if (<var>expression-1</var>)
  <var>statements-1</var>
elseif (<var>expression-2</var>)
  <var>statements-2</var>
elseif (<var>expression-3</var>)
  <var>statements-3</var>
else
  <var>statements-4</var>
endif
</pre>
<p>Note that <span class="cmd">elseif</span> is written as a single word, without any spaces.  This
simpler version has the very same meaning as the original: evaluate
<var>expression-i</var> for <var>i</var> equal to 1, 2, and 3, in turn, until one of
them returns a true value; then execute the <var>statements-i</var> associated with
that expression.  If none of the <var>expression-i</var> return a true value, then
execute <var>statements-4</var>.</p>
<p>Any number of <span class="cmd">elseif</span> phrases can appear, each having this form:</p>
<pre>
elseif (<var>expression</var>) 
    <var>statements</var>
</pre>
<p>The complete syntax of the <span class="cmd">if</span> statement, therefore, is as follows:</p>
<pre>
if (<var>expression</var>)
  <var>statements</var>
<var>zero-or-more-elseif-phrases</var>
<var>an-optional-else-phrase</var>
endif
</pre>
<h4 id="statements-for-looping">Statements for Looping</h4>
<p>MOO provides three different kinds of looping statements, allowing you to have
a set of statements executed (1) once for each element of a given list, (2)
once for each integer or object number in a given range, and (3) over and over
until a given condition stops being true.</p>
<h5 id="the-for-in-loop">The for-in loop</h5>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">Note:</span> In some programming languages this is
    referred to as a foreach loop.  The syntax and usage is roughly the same.
</div>
<p>To perform some statements once for each element of a given list, use this
syntax:</p>
<pre>
for <var>variable</var> in (<var>expression</var>)
  <var>statements</var>
endfor
</pre>
<p>The expression is evaluated and should return a list; if it does not,
<span class="cmd">E_TYPE</span> is raised.  The <var>statements</var> are then executed once for
each element of that list in turn; each time, the given <var>variable</var> is
assigned the value of the element in question.  For example, consider
the following statements:</p>
<pre>
odds = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9};
evens = {};
for n in (odds)
  evens = {@evens, n + 1};
endfor
</pre>
<p>The value of the variable <span class="cmd">evens</span> after executing these statements
is the list</p>
<pre>
{2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
</pre>
<p>Another example of this, looping over all the children of an object:</p>
<pre>
for child in (children(obj))
    notify(player, tostr(o.name, " is located in ", o.location));
endfor
</pre>
<p>Another exmaple of this, looping over a list of strings:</p>
<pre>
strings = {"foo", "bar", "baz"};
for string in (strings)
    notify(player, string);
endfor
</pre>
<h5 id="the-for-range-loop">The For-Range Loop</h5>
<p>To perform a set of statements once for each integer or object number in a given
range, use this syntax:</p>
<pre>
for <var>variable</var> in [<var>expression-1</var>..<var>expression-2</var>]
  <var>statements</var>
endfor
</pre>
<p>The two expressions are evaluated in turn and should either both return integers
or both return object numbers; <span class="cmd">E_TYPE</span> is raised otherwise.  The
<var>statements</var> are then executed once for each integer (or object number, as
appropriate) greater than or equal to the value of <var>expression-1</var> and less
than or equal to the result of <var>expression-2</var>, in increasing order.  Each
time, the given variable is assigned the integer or object number in question.
For example, consider the following statements:</p>
<pre>
evens = {};
for n in [1..5]
  evens = {@evens, 2 * n};
endfor
</pre>
<p>The value of the variable <span class="cmd">evens</span> after executing these statements
is just as in the previous example: the list</p>
<pre>
{2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
</pre>
<p>The following loop over object numbers prints out the number and name of every
valid object in the database:</p>
<pre>
for o in [#0..max_object()]
  if (valid(o))
    notify(player, tostr(o, ": ", o.name));
  endif
endfor
</pre>
<h5 id="the-while-loop">The While Loop</h5>
<p>The final kind of loop in MOO executes a set of statements repeatedly as long
as a given condition remains true:</p>
<pre>
while (<var>expression</var>)
  <var>statements</var>
endwhile
</pre>
<p>The expression is evaluated and, if it returns a true value, the
<var>statements</var> are executed; then, execution of the <span class="cmd">while</span> statement
begins all over again with the evaluation of the expression.  That is,
execution alternates between evaluating the expression and executing the
statements until the expression returns a false value.  The following
example code has precisely the same effect as the loop just shown above:</p>
<pre>
evens = {};
n = 1;
while (n &#60;= 5)
  evens = {@evens, 2 * n};
  n = n + 1;
endwhile
</pre>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">Fine point:</span>  It is also possible to give a <em>name</em> to a <span class="cmd">while</span> loop.
</div>
<pre>
while <var>name</var> (<var>expression</var>)
  <var>statements</var>
endwhile
</pre>
<p>which has precisely the same effect as</p>
<pre>
while (<var>name</var> = <var>expression</var>)
  <var>statements</var>
endwhile
</pre>
<p>This naming facility is only really useful in conjunction with the <span class="cmd">break</span>
and <span class="cmd">continue</span> statements, described in the next section.</p>
<p>With each kind of loop, it is possible that the statements in the body of the
loop will never be executed at all.  For iteration over lists, this happens
when the list returned by the expression is empty.  For iteration on integers,
it happens when <var>expression-1</var> returns a larger integer than
<var>expression-2</var>.  Finally, for the <span class="cmd">while</span> loop, it happens if the
expression returns a false value the very first time it is evaluated.
<div class="alert alert-warning">
    <span class="label label-warning">Warning:</span> With <span class="cmd">while</span> loops it is especially
    important to make sure you do not create an infinite loop.  That is, a loop that will never terminate because
    it's expression will never become false.
</div>
<h4 id="terminating-one-or-all-iterations-of-a-loop">Terminating One or All Iterations of a Loop</h4>
<p>Sometimes, it is useful to exit a loop before it finishes all of its
iterations.  For example, if the loop is used to search for a particular kind
of element of a list, then it might make sense to stop looping as soon as the
right kind of element is found, even if there are more elements yet to see.
The <span class="cmd">break</span> statement is used for this purpose; it has the form</p>
<pre>
break;
</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>
break <var>name</var>;
</pre>
<p>Each <span class="cmd">break</span> statement indicates a specific surrounding loop; if
<var>name</var> is not given, the statement refers to the innermost one.  If it is
given, <var>name</var> must be the name appearing right after the <span class="cmd">for</span> or
<span class="cmd">while</span> keyword of the desired enclosing loop.  When the <span class="cmd">break</span>
statement is executed, the indicated loop is immediately terminated and
executing continues just as if the loop had completed its iterations normally.</p>
<p>MOO also allows you to terminate just the current iteration of a loop, making
it immediately go on to the next one, if any.  The <span class="cmd">continue</span> statement
does this; it has precisely the same forms as the <span class="cmd">break</span> statement:</p>
<pre>
continue;
</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>
continue <var>name</var>;
</pre>
<p>An example that sums up a list of integers, excluding any integer equal to four:</p>
<pre>
my_list = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
sum = 0;
for element in (my_list)
    if (element == 4)
        continue;
    endif
    sum = sum + element;
endfor
</pre>
<p>An example that </p>
<pre>
my_list = {#13633, #98, #15840, #18657, #22664};
i = 0;
found = 0;
for obj in (my_list)
    i = i + 1;
    if (obj == #18657)
        found = 1;
        break;
    endif
endfor
if (found)
    notify(player, tostr("found #18657 at ", i, " index"));
else
    notify(player, "couldn't find #18657 in the list!");
endif
</pre>
<h4 id="returning-a-value-from-a-verb">Returning a Value from a Verb</h4>
<p>The MOO program in a verb is just a sequence of statements.  Normally, when
the verb is called, those statements are simply executed in order and then the
integer 0 is returned as the value of the verb-call expression.  Using the
<span class="cmd">return</span> statement, one can change this behavior.  The <span class="cmd">return</span>
statement has one of the following two forms:</p>
<pre>
return;
</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>
return <var>expression</var>;
</pre>
<p>When it is executed, execution of the current verb is terminated immediately
after evaluating the given <var>expression</var>, if any.  The verb-call expression
that started the execution of this verb then returns either the value of
<var>expression</var> or the integer 0, if no <var>expression</var> was provided.
<p>We could modify the example given above.  Imagine a verb called <var>has_object</var> which takes an object (that we want to find) as it's
first argument and a list of objects (to search) as it's second argument:</p>
<pre>
{seek_obj, list_of_objects} = args;
for obj in (list_of_objects)
    if (obj == seek_obj)
        return 1;
    endif
endfor
</pre>
<p>The verb above could be called with <span class="cmd"><var>obj_with_verb</var>:<var>has_object</var>(<var>#18657</var>, 
<var>{#1, #3, #4, #3000}</span>)</span> 
and it would return <span class="cmd">false</span> (0) if the object was 
not found in the list.  It would return <span class="cmd">true</span> (1) if the object was found in the list.</p>
<p>Of course we could write this much simplier (and get the index of the object in the list at the same time):</p>
<pre>
{seek_obj, list_of_objects} = args;
return seek_obj in list_of_objects;
</pre>
<h4 id="handling-errors-in-statements">Handling Errors in Statements</h4>
<p>Normally, whenever a piece of MOO code raises an error, the entire task is
aborted and a message printed to the user.  Often, such errors can be
anticipated in advance by the programmer and code written to deal with them in
a more graceful manner.  The <span class="cmd">try</span>-<span class="cmd">except</span> statement allows you to
do this; the syntax is as follows:</p>
<pre>
try
  <var>statements-0</var>
except <var>variable-1</var> (<var>codes-1</var>)
  <var>statements-1</var>
except <var>variable-2</var> (<var>codes-2</var>)
  <var>statements-2</var>
...
endtry
</pre>
<p>where the <var>variable</var>s may be omitted and each <var>codes</var> part is either
the keyword <span class="cmd">ANY</span> or else a comma-separated list of expressions, just like
an argument list.  As in an argument list, the splicing operator (<span class="cmd">@</span>)
can be used here.  There can be anywhere from 1 to 255 <span class="cmd">except</span> clauses.</p>
<p>First, each <var>codes</var> part is evaluated, yielding a list of error codes that
should be caught if they're raised; if a <var>codes</var> is <span class="cmd">ANY</span>, then it is
equivalent to the list of all possible MOO values.</p>
<p>Next, <var>statements-0</var> is executed; if it doesn't raise an error, then that's
all that happens for the entire <span class="cmd">try</span>-<span class="cmd">except</span> statement.  Otherwise,
let <var>E</var> be the error it raises.  From top to bottom, <var>E</var> is searched
for in the lists resulting from the various <var>codes</var> parts; if it isn't
found in any of them, then it continues to be raised, possibly to be caught by
some piece of code either surrounding this <span class="cmd">try</span>-<span class="cmd">except</span> statement
or higher up on the verb-call stack.</p>
<p>If <var>E</var> is found first in <var>codes-i</var>, then <var>variable-i</var> (if provided)
is assigned a value containing information about the error being raised and
<var>statements-i</var> is executed.  The value assigned to <var>variable-i</var> is a
list of four elements:
</p>
<pre>
{<var>code</var>, <var>message</var>, <var>value</var>, <var>traceback</var>}
</pre>
<p>where <var>code</var> is <var>E</var>, the error being raised, <var>message</var> and
<var>value</var> are as provided by the code that raised the error, and
<var>traceback</var> is a list like that returned by the <span class="cmd">callers()</span> function,
including line numbers.  The <var>traceback</var> list contains entries for every
verb from the one that raised the error through the one containing this
<span class="cmd">try</span>-<span class="cmd">except</span> statement.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise mentioned, all of the built-in errors raised by expressions,
statements, and functions provide <span class="cmd">tostr(<var>code</var>)</span> as <var>message</var> and
zero as <var>value</var>.</p>
<p>Here's an example of the use of this kind of statement:</p>
<pre>
try
  result = object:(command)(@arguments);
  player:tell("=&#62; ", toliteral(result));
except v (ANY)
  tb = v[4];
  if (length(tb) == 1)
    player:tell("** Illegal command: ", v[2]);
  else
    top = tb[1];
    tb[1..1] = {};
    player:tell(top[1], ":", top[2], ", line ", top[6], ":", v[2]);
    for fr in (tb)
      player:tell("... called from ", fr[1], ":", fr[2], ", line ", fr[6]);
    endfor
    player:tell("(End of traceback)");
  endif
endtry
</pre>
<h4 id="cleaning-up-after-errors">Cleaning Up After Errors</h4>
<p>Whenever an error is raised, it is usually the case that at least some MOO code
gets skipped over and never executed.  Sometimes, it's important that a piece
of code <em>always</em> be executed, whether or not an error is raised.  Use the
<span class="cmd">try</span>-<span class="cmd">finally</span> statement for these cases; it has the following
syntax:</p>
<pre>
try
  <var>statements-1</var>
finally
  <var>statements-2</var>
endtry
</pre>
<p>First, <var>statements-1</var> is executed; if it completes without raising an
error, returning from this verb, or terminating the current iteration of a
surrounding loop (we call these possibilities <em>transferring control</em>), then
<var>statements-2</var> is executed and that's all that happens for the entire
<span class="cmd">try</span>-<span class="cmd">finally</span> statement.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the process of transferring control is interrupted and
<var>statments-2</var> is executed.  If <var>statements-2</var> itself completes without
transferring control, then the interrupted control transfer is resumed just
where it left off.  If <var>statements-2</var> does transfer control, then the
interrupted transfer is simply forgotten in favor of the new one.</p>
<p>In short, this statement ensures that <var>statements-2</var> is executed after
control leaves <var>statements-1</var> for whatever reason; it can thus be used to
make sure that some piece of cleanup code is run even if <var>statements-1</var>
doesn't simply run normally to completion.</p>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
<pre>
try
  start = time();
  object:(command)(@arguments);
finally
  end = time();
  this:charge_user_for_seconds(player, end - start);
endtry
</pre>
<h4 id="executing-statements-at-a-later-time">Executing Statements at a Later Time</h4>
<p>It is sometimes useful to have some sequence of statements execute at a later
time, without human intervention.  For example, one might implement an object
that, when thrown into the air, eventually falls back to the ground; the
<span class="cmd">throw</span> verb on that object should arrange to print a message about the
object landing on the ground, but the message shouldn't be printed until some
number of seconds have passed.</p>
<p>The <span class="cmd">fork</span> statement is intended for just such situations and has the
following syntax:</p>
<pre>
fork (<var>expression</var>)
  <var>statements</var>
endfork
</pre>
<p>The <span class="cmd">fork</span> statement first executes the expression, which must return a
integer; call that integer <var>n</var>.  It then creates a new MOO <em>task</em> that
will, after at least <var>n</var> seconds, execute the statements.  When the new
task begins, all variables will have the values they had at the time the
<span class="cmd">fork</span> statement was executed.  The task executing the <span class="cmd">fork</span>
statement immediately continues execution.  The concept of tasks is discussed
in detail in the next section.</p>
<p>By default, there is no limit to the number of tasks any player may fork, but
such a limit can be imposed from within the database.  See the chapter on
server assumptions about the database for details.</p>
<p>Occasionally, one would like to be able to kill a forked task before it even
starts; for example, some player might have caught the object that was thrown
into the air, so no message should be printed about it hitting the ground.  If
a variable name is given after the <span class="cmd">fork</span> keyword, like this:</p>
<pre>
fork <var>name</var> (<var>expression</var>)
  <var>statements</var>
endfork
</pre>
<p>then that variable is assigned the <em>task ID</em> of the newly-created task.
The value of this variable is visible both to the task executing the fork
statement and to the statements in the newly-created task.  This ID can be
passed to the <span class="cmd">kill_task()</span> function to keep the task from running and
will be the value of <span class="cmd">task_id()</span> once the task begins execution.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">Note:</span> This feature has other uses as well.  The MOO
    is single threaded, which means that complex logic (verbs that call verbs that call verbs ...) can
    cause the MOO to <em>lag</em>.  For instance, let's say when your user tosses their ball up, you want
    to calculate a complex trejectory involve the ball and other objects in the room.  These calculations are 
    costly and done in another verb, they take time to be performed.  However, you want some actions to happen both before the calculations
    (everyone in the room seeing the ball is thrown into the air) and after the ball has left the players hands (the player
    reaches into their pocket and pulls out a new ball).  If there is no <span class="cmd">fork()</span> then the calculations need to complete before
    the verb can continue execution, which means the player won't pull out a fresh ball until after the calculations are complete.  A
    <span class="cmd">fork()</span> allows the player to throw the ball, the MOO to <span class="cmd">fork()</span> the task, which allows execution of the verb to continue right away
    and the user to pull out a new ball, without experiencing the delay that the calculations being returned (without a <span class="cmd">fork()</span>) would have inccured.
</div>
<p>An example of this:</p>
<pre>
{ball} = args;
player:tell("You throw the ball!");
ball:calculate_trajectory();
player:tell("You get out another ball!");
</pre>
<p>In the above example, <span class="cmd">player:tell("You get out another ball!");</span> will not be executed until
after <span class="cmd">ball:calculate_trajectory();</span> is completed.</p>
<pre>
{ball} = args;
player:tell("You throw the ball!");
fork (1)
    ball:calculate_trajectory();
endfor
player:tell("You get out another ball!");
</pre>
<p>In this forked example, the ball will be thrown, the task forked for 1 second later and the the final line telling the player they
got out another ball will be followed up right after, without having to wait for the trajectory verb to finish running.</p>
<p>This type of fork cannot be used if the trajectory is required by the code that runs after it. For instance:</p>
<pre>
{ball} = args;
player:tell("You throw the ball!");
direction = ball:calculate_trajectory();
player:tell("You get out another ball!");
player:tell("Your ball arcs to the " + direction);
</pre>
<p>If the above task was forked as it is below:</p>
<pre>
{ball} = args;
player:tell("You throw the ball!");
fork (1)
    direction = ball:calculate_trajectory();
endfork
player:tell("You get out another ball!");
player:tell("Your ball arcs to the " + direction);
</pre>
<p>The verb would raise <span class="cmd">E_VARNF</span> due to direction not being defined.</p>
<h3 id="moo-tasks">MOO Tasks</h3>
<p>A <em>task</em> is an execution of a MOO program.  There are five kinds of tasks
in LambdaMOO:
<ul>
    <li>Every time a player types a command, a task is created to execute that
    command; we call these <em>command tasks</em>.</li>
    <li>Whenever a player connects or disconnects from the MOO, the server starts a
    task to do whatever processing is necessary, such as printing out
    <span class="cmd">Munchkin has connected</span> to all of the players in the same room; these
    are called <em>server tasks</em>.</li>
    <li>The <span class="cmd">fork</span> statement in the programming language creates a task whose
    execution is delayed for at least some given number of seconds; these are
    <em>forked tasks</em>.</li>
    <li>The <span class="cmd">suspend()</span> function suspends the execution of the current task.  A
    snapshot is taken of whole state of the execution, and the execution will be
    resumed later.  These are called <em>suspended tasks</em>.</li>
    <li>The <span class="cmd">read()</span> function also suspends the execution of the current task, in
    this case waiting for the player to type a line of input.  When the line is
    received, the task resumes with the <span class="cmd">read()</span> function returning the input
    line as result.  These are called <em>reading tasks</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last three kinds of tasks above are collectively known as <em>queued
tasks</em> or <em>background tasks</em>, since they may not run immediately.</p>
<p>To prevent a maliciously- or incorrectly-written MOO program from running
forever and monopolizing the server, limits are placed on the running time of
every task.  One limit is that no task is allowed to run longer than a certain
number of seconds; command and server tasks get five seconds each while other
tasks get only three seconds.  This limit is, in practice, rarely reached.  The
reason is that there is also a limit on the number of operations a task may
execute.</p>
<p>The server counts down <em>ticks</em> as any task executes.  Roughly speaking, it
counts one tick for every expression evaluation (other than variables and
literals), one for every <span class="cmd">if</span>, <span class="cmd">fork</span> or <span class="cmd">return</span> statement, and
one for every iteration of a loop.  If the count gets all the way down to zero,
the task is immediately and unceremoniously aborted.  By default, command and
server tasks begin with an store of 30,000 ticks; this is enough for almost all
normal uses.  Forked, suspended, and reading tasks are allotted 15,000 ticks
each.</p>
<p>These limits on seconds and ticks may be changed from within the database, as
can the behavior of the server after it aborts a task for running out; see the
chapter on server assumptions about the database for details.</p>
<p>Because queued tasks may exist for long periods of time before they begin
execution, there are functions to list the ones that you own and to kill them
before they execute.  These functions, among others, are discussed in the
following section.</p>
<h3 id="built-in-functions">Built-in Functions</h3>
<p>There are a large number of built-in functions available for use by MOO
programmers.  Each one is discussed in detail in this section.  The
presentation is broken up into subsections by grouping together functions with
similar or related uses.</p>
<p>For most functions, the expected types of the arguments are given; if the
actual arguments are not of these types, <span class="cmd">E_TYPE</span> is raised.  Some
arguments can be of any type at all; in such cases, no type specification is
given for the argument.  Also, for most functions, the type of the result of
the function is given.  Some functions do not return a useful result; in such
cases, the specification <span class="cmd">none</span> is used.  A few functions can potentially
return any type of value at all; in such cases, the specification <span class="cmd">value</span>
is used.</p>
<p>Most functions take a certain fixed number of required arguments and, in some
cases, one or two optional arguments.  If a function is called with too many or
too few arguments, <span class="cmd">E_ARGS</span> is raised.</p>
<p>Functions are always called by the program for some verb; that program is
running with the permissions of some player, usually the owner of the verb in
question (it is not always the owner, though; wizards can use
<span class="cmd">set_task_perms()</span> to change the permissions <em>on the fly</em>).  In the
function descriptions below, we refer to the player whose permissions are being
used as the <em>programmer</em>.</p>
<p>Many built-in functions are described below as raising <span class="cmd">E_PERM</span> unless
the programmer meets certain specified criteria.  It is possible to restrict
use of any function, however, so that only wizards can use it; see the chapter
on server assumptions about the database for details.</p>
<h4 id="object-oriented-programming">Object-Oriented Programming</h4>
<p>One of the most important facilities in an object-oriented programming language
is ability for a child object to make use of a parent's implementation of some
operation, even when the child provides its own definition for that operation.
The <span class="cmd">pass()</span> function provides this facility in MOO.</p>
<article class="well bg-info text-info" id="function-pass">
    <strong><u>function:</u> <span class="cmd">pass</span></strong>
    <p>pass -- calls the verb with the same name as the current verb but as defined on the parent of the object 
    that defines the current verb.</p>
    <div class="well bg-info"><var>value</var> <span class="cmd">pass</span> (<var>arg</var>, ...)</div>
    <p>Often, it is useful for a child object to define a verb that <em>augments</em>
    the behavior of a verb on its parent object.  For example, in the LambdaCore
    database, the root object (which is an ancestor of every other object) defines
    a verb called <span class="cmd">description</span> that simply returns the value of
    <span class="cmd">this.description</span>; this verb is used by the implementation of the
    <span class="cmd">look</span> command.  In many cases, a programmer would like the description of
    some object to include some non-constant part; for example, a sentence about
    whether or not the object was `awake' or `sleeping'.  This sentence should be
    added onto the end of the normal description.  The programmer would like to
    have a means of calling the normal <span class="cmd">description</span> verb and then appending
    the sentence onto the end of that description.  The function <span class="cmd">pass()</span> is
    for exactly such situations.</p>
    <p><span class="cmd">pass</span> calls the verb with the same name as the current verb but as
    defined on the parent of the object that defines the current verb.  The
    arguments given to <span class="cmd">pass</span> are the ones given to the called verb and the
    returned value of the called verb is returned from the call to <span class="cmd">pass</span>.
    The initial value of <span class="cmd">this</span> in the called verb is the same as in the
    calling verb.</p>
    <p>Thus, in the example above, the child-object's <span class="cmd">description</span> verb might
    have the following implementation:</p>
<pre>
return pass() + "  It is " + (this.awake ? "awake." | "sleeping.");
</pre>
    <p>That is, it calls its parent's <span class="cmd">description</span> verb and then appends to the
    result a sentence whose content is computed based on the value of a property on
    the object.</p>
    <p>In almost all cases, you will want to call <span class="cmd">pass()</span> with the same
    arguments as were given to the current verb.  This is easy to write in MOO;
    just call <span class="cmd">pass(@args)</span>.</p>

<h4 id="manipulating-moo-values">Manipulating MOO Values</h4>
<p>There are several functions for performing primitive operations on MOO values,
and they can be cleanly split into two kinds: those that do various very
general operations that apply to all types of values, and those that are
specific to one particular type.  There are so many operations concerned with
objects that we do not list them in this section but rather give them their own
section following this one.</p>
<h5 id="general-operations-applicable-to-all-values">General Operations Applicable to all Values</h5>
<article class="well bg-info text-info" id="function-typeof">
    <strong><u>Function:</u> <span class="cmd">typeof</span></strong>
    <p>typeof -- Takes any MOO value and returns an integer representing the type of <var>value</var>.</p>
    <div class="well bg-info"><var>int</var> <span class="cmd">typeof</span> (<var>value</var>)</div>
    <p>The result is the same as the initial value of one of these built-in variables:
    <span class="cmd">INT</span>, <span class="cmd">FLOAT</span>, <span class="cmd">STR</span>, <span class="cmd">LIST</span>, <span class="cmd">OBJ</span>, or <span class="cmd">ERR</span>.
    Thus, one usually writes code like this:</p>
<pre>
if (typeof(x) == LIST) ...
</pre>
    <p>and not like this:</p>
<pre>
if (typeof(x) == 3) ...
</pre>
    <p>because the former is much more readable than the latter.</p>

<h5 id="regular-expressions">Regular Expressions</h5>
<p<em>Regular expression</em> matching allows you to test whether a string fits into
a specific syntactic shape.  You can also search a string for a substring that
fits a pattern.</p>
<p>A regular expression describes a set of strings.  The simplest case is one that
describes a particular string; for example, the string <span class="cmd">foo</span> when regarded
as a regular expression matches <span class="cmd">foo</span> and nothing else.  Nontrivial
regular expressions use certain special constructs so that they can match more
than one string.  For example, the regular expression <span class="cmd">foo%|bar</span> matches
either the string <span class="cmd">foo</span> or the string <span class="cmd">bar</span>; the regular expression
<span class="cmd">c[ad]*r</span> matches any of the strings <span class="cmd">cr</span>, <span class="cmd">car</span>,
<span class="cmd">cdr</span>,
<span class="cmd">caar</span>, <span class="cmd">cadddar</span> and all other such strings with any number of
<span class="cmd">a</span>'s and <span class="cmd">d</span>'s.</p>
<p>Regular expressions have a syntax in which a few characters are special
constructs and the rest are <em>ordinary</em>.  An ordinary character is a simple
regular expression that matches that character and nothing else.  The special
characters are <span class="cmd">$</span>, <span class="cmd">^</span>, <span class="cmd">.</span>, <span class="cmd">*</span>, 
<span class="cmd">+</span>, <span class="cmd">?</span>,
<span class="cmd">[</span>, <span class="cmd">]</span> and <span class="cmd">%</span>.  Any other character appearing in a regular
expression is ordinary, unless a <span class="cmd">%</span> precedes it.</p>
<p>For example, <span class="cmd">f</span> is not a special character, so it is ordinary, and
therefore <span class="cmd">f</span> is a regular expression that matches the string <span class="cmd">f</span> and
no other string.  (It does <em>not</em>, for example, match the string
<span class="cmd">ff</span>.)  Likewise, <span class="cmd">o</span> is a regular expression that matches only
<span class="cmd">o</span>.</p>
<p>Any two regular expressions <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> can be concatenated.  The
result is a regular expression which matches a string if <var>a</var> matches some
amount of the beginning of that string and <var>b</var> matches the rest of the
string.</p>
<p>As a simple example, we can concatenate the regular expressions <span class="cmd">f</span> and
<span class="cmd">o</span> to get the regular expression <span class="cmd">fo</span>, which matches only the string
<span class="cmd">fo</span>.  Still trivial.</p>
<p>The following are the characters and character sequences that have special
meaning within regular expressions.  Any character not mentioned here is not
special; it stands for exactly itself for the purposes of searching and
matching.
<dl class="dl-hortizontal">
    <dt><span class="cmd">.</span></dt>
    <dd>is a special character that matches any single character.  Using concatenation,
    we can make regular expressions like <span class="cmd">a.b</span>, which matches any
    three-character string that begins with <span class="cmd">a</span> and ends with <span class="cmd">b</span>.</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">*</span></dt>
    <dd>is not a construct by itself; it is a suffix that means that the preceding
    regular expression is to be repeated as many times as possible.  In <span class="cmd">fo*</span>,
    the <span class="cmd">*</span> applies to the <span class="cmd">o</span>, so <span class="cmd">fo*</span> matches <span class="cmd">f</span> followed
    by any number of <span class="cmd">o</span>'s.  The case of zero <span class="cmd">o</span>'s is allowed:
    <span class="cmd">fo*</span> does match <span class="cmd">f</span>.
    <span class="cmd">*</span> always applies to the <em>smallest</em> possible preceding expression.
    Thus, <span class="cmd">fo*</span> has a repeating <span class="cmd">o</span>, not a repeating <span class="cmd">fo</span>.
    The matcher processes a <span class="cmd">*</span> construct by matching, immediately, as many
    repetitions as can be found.  Then it continues with the rest of the pattern.
    If that fails, it backtracks, discarding some of the matches of the <span class="cmd">*</span>'d
    construct in case that makes it possible to match the rest of the pattern.  For
    example, matching <span class="cmd">c[ad]*ar</span> against the string <span class="cmd">caddaar</span>, the
    <span class="cmd">[ad]*</span> first matches <span class="cmd">addaa</span>, but this does not allow the next
    <span class="cmd">a</span> in the pattern to match.  So the last of the matches of <span class="cmd">[ad]</span> is
    undone and the following <span class="cmd">a</span> is tried again.  Now it succeeds.</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">+</span></dt>
    <dd><span class="cmd">+</span> is like <span class="cmd">*</span> except that at least one match for the preceding
    pattern is required for <span class="cmd">+</span>.  Thus, <span class="cmd">c[ad]+r</span> does not match
    <span class="cmd">cr</span> but does match anything else that <span class="cmd">c[ad]*r</span> would match.</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">?</span></dt>
    <dd><span class="cmd">?</span> is like <span class="cmd">*</span> except that it allows either zero or one match for
    the preceding pattern.  Thus, <span class="cmd">c[ad]?r</span> matches <span class="cmd">cr</span> or <span class="cmd">car</span> or
    <span class="cmd">cdr</span>, and nothing else.</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">[ ... ]</span></dt>
    <dd>
        <span class="cmd">[</span> begins a <em>character set</em>, which is terminated by a <span class="cmd">]</span>.  In
        the simplest case, the characters between the two brackets form the set.  Thus,
        <span class="cmd">[ad]</span> matches either <span class="cmd">a</span> or <span class="cmd">d</span>, and <span class="cmd">[ad]*</span> matches any
        string of <span class="cmd">a</span>'s and <span class="cmd">d</span>'s (including the empty string), from which it
        follows that <span class="cmd">c[ad]*r</span> matches <span class="cmd">car</span>, etc.
        <p>Character ranges can also be included in a character set, by writing two
        characters with a <span class="cmd">-</span> between them.  Thus, <span class="cmd">[a-z]</span> matches any
        lower-case letter.  Ranges may be intermixed freely with individual characters,
        as in <span class="cmd">[a-z$%.]</span>, which matches any lower case letter or <span class="cmd">$</span>,
        <span class="cmd">%</span> or period.</p>
        
        <p>Note that the usual special characters are not special any more inside a
        character set.  A completely different set of special characters exists inside
        character sets: <span class="cmd">]</span>, <span class="cmd">-</span> and <span class="cmd">^</span>.</p>
        
        <p>To include a <span class="cmd">]</span> in a character set, you must make it the first character.
        For example, <span class="cmd">[]a]</span> matches <span class="cmd">]</span> or <span class="cmd">a</span>.  To include a <span class="cmd">-</span>,
        you must use it in a context where it cannot possibly indicate a range: that
        is, as the first character, or immediately after a range.</p>
    </dd>
    
    <dt><span class="cmd">[^ ... ]</span></dt>
    <dd>
        <p><span class="cmd">[^</span> begins a <em>complement character set</em>, which matches any character
        except the ones specified.  Thus, <span class="cmd">[^a-z0-9A-Z]</span> matches all characters
        <em>except</em> letters and digits.</p>
        <p><span class="cmd">^</span> is not special in a character set unless it is the first character.
        The character following the <span class="cmd">^</span> is treated as if it were first (it may be
        a <span class="cmd">-</span> or a <span class="cmd">]</span>).</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">^</span></dt>
    <dd>is a special character that matches the empty string -- but only if at the
    beginning of the string being matched.  Otherwise it fails to match anything.
    Thus, <span class="cmd">^foo</span> matches a <span class="cmd">foo</span> which occurs at the beginning of the
    string.</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">$</span></dt>
    <dd>is similar to <span class="cmd">^</span> but matches only at the <em>end</em> of the string.  Thus,
    <span class="cmd">xx*$</span> matches a string of one or more <span class="cmd">x</span>'s at the end of the
    string.</dd>
    
    <dt><span class="cmd">%</span></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>has two functions: it quotes the above special characters (including <span class="cmd">%</span>),
        and it introduces additional special constructs.</p>
        
        <p>Because <span class="cmd">%</span> quotes special characters, <span class="cmd">%$</span> is a regular expression
        that matches only <span class="cmd">$</span>, and <span class="cmd">%[</span> is a regular expression that matches
        only <span class="cmd">[</span>, and so on.</p>
        
        <p>For the most part, <span class="cmd">%</span> followed by any character matches only that
        character.  However, there are several exceptions: characters that, when
        preceded by <span class="cmd">%</span>, are special constructs.  Such characters are always
        ordinary when encountered on their own.</p>
        
        <p>No new special characters will ever be defined.  All extensions to the regular
        expression syntax are made by defining new two-character constructs that begin
        with <span class="cmd">%</span>.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">%|</span></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>specifies an alternative.  Two regular expressions <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> with
        <span class="cmd">%|</span> in between form an expression that matches anything that either
        <var>a</var> or <var>b</var> will match.</p>
        <p>Thus, <span class="cmd">foo%|bar</span> matches either <span class="cmd">foo</span> or <span class="cmd">bar</span> but no other
        string.</p>
        <p><span class="cmd">%|</span> applies to the largest possible surrounding expressions.  Only a
        surrounding <span class="cmd">%( ... %)</span> grouping can limit the grouping power of
        <span class="cmd">%|</span>.</p>
        <p>Full backtracking capability exists for when multiple <span class="cmd">%|</span>'s are used.</p>
    <dt><span class="cmd">%( ... %)</span></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>is a grouping construct that serves three purposes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To enclose a set of <span class="cmd">%|</span> alternatives for other operations.  Thus,
                <span class="cmd">%(foo%|bar%)x</span> matches either <span class="cmd">foox</span> or <span class="cmd">barx</span>.
            </li>
            <li>
                To enclose a complicated expression for a following <span class="cmd">*</span>, <span class="cmd">+</span>, or
                <span class="cmd">?</span> to operate on.  Thus, <span class="cmd">ba%(na%)*</span> matches <span class="cmd">bananana</span>, etc.,
                with any number of <span class="cmd">na</span>'s, including none.
            </li>
            <li>
                To mark a matched substring for future reference.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>This last application is not a consequence of the idea of a parenthetical
        grouping; it is a separate feature that happens to be assigned as a second
        meaning to the same <span class="cmd">%( ... %)</span> construct because there is no conflict
        in practice between the two meanings.  Here is an explanation of this feature:</p>
    <dt><span class="cmd">%<var>digit</var></span></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>After the end of a <span class="cmd">%( ... %)</span> construct, the matcher remembers the
        beginning and end of the text matched by that construct.  Then, later on in the
        regular expression, you can use <span class="cmd">%</span> followed by <var>digit</var> to mean
        "match the same text matched by the <var>digit</var>'th <span class="cmd">%( ... %)</span>
        construct in the pattern."  The <span class="cmd">%( ... %)</span> constructs are numbered
        in the order that their <span class="cmd">%(</span>'s appear in the pattern.</p>
        <p>The strings matching the first nine <span class="cmd">%( ... %)</span> constructs appearing
        in a regular expression are assigned numbers 1 through 9 in order of their
        beginnings.  <span class="cmd">%1</span> through <span class="cmd">%9</span> may be used to refer to the text
        matched by the corresponding <span class="cmd">%( ... %)</span> construct.</p>
        <p>For example, <span class="cmd">%(.*%)%1</span> matches any string that is composed of two
        identical halves.  The <span class="cmd">%(.*%)</span> matches the first half, which may be
        anything, but the <span class="cmd">%1</span> that follows must match the same exact text.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">%b</span></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>matches the empty string, but only if it is at the beginning or
        end of a word.  Thus, <span class="cmd">%bfoo%b</span> matches any occurrence of
        <span class="cmd">foo</span> as a separate word.  <span class="cmd">%bball%(s%|%)%b</span> matches
        <span class="cmd">ball</span> or <span class="cmd">balls</span> as a separate word.</p>
        <p>For the purposes of this construct and the five that follow, a word is defined
        to be a sequence of letters and/or digits.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">%B</span></dt>
    <dd>matches the empty string, provided it is <em>not</em> at the beginning or
    end of a word.</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">%&#60;</span></dt>
    <dd>matches the empty string, but only if it is at the beginning of a word.</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">%&#62;</span></dt>
    <dd>matches the empty string, but only if it is at the end of a word.</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">%w</span></dt>
    <dd>matches any word-constituent character (i.e., any letter or digit).</dd>
    <dt><span class="cmd">%W</span></dt>
    <dd>matches any character that is not a word constituent.</dd>

<article class="well bg-info text-info" id="function-is-member">
    <strong><u>Function:</u> <span class="cmd">create</span></strong>

    is as described below.</p>
    <div class="well bg-info"><var>obj</var> <span class="cmd">create</span> (obj <var>parent</var> [, obj <var>owner</var>])</div>
    <p>Either the given <var>parent</var> object must be <span class="cmd">#-1</span>
    or valid and fertile (i.e., its <span class="cmd">f</span> bit must be set) or else the

    raised.  <span class="cmd">E_PERM</span> is also raised if <var>owner</var> is provided and not
    the same as the programmer, unless the programmer is a wizard.  After the new
    object is created, its <span class="cmd">initialize</span> verb, if any, is called with no
    arguments.</p>
    <p>The new object is assigned the least non-negative object number that has not
    yet been used for a created object.  Note that no object number is ever reused,
    even if the object with that number is recycled.</p>
    <div class="alert alert-warning">This is not strictly true, especially if you are using LambdaCore and the <span class="cmd">$recycler</span>, which is a great idea.  
    If you don't, you end up with extremely high object numbers.  However, if you plan on reusing object numbers you need to consider this carefully in your code.  You
    do not want to include object numbers in your code if this is the case, as object numbers could change.  Use corified references instead (IE: <span class="cmd">
    @prop #0.my_object #objnum</span> allows you to use $my_object in your code.  If the object number ever changes, you can change the reference without updating 
    all of your code.)</span></div>
    <p>The owner of the new object is either the programmer (if <var>owner</var> is not
    provided), the new object itself (if <var>owner</var> was given as <span class="cmd">#-1</span>), or
    <var>owner</var> (otherwise).</p>
    <p>The other built-in properties of the new object are initialized as follows:</p>

programmer   0
wizard       0
r            0
w            0
f            0
</pre>
    <p>The function <span class="cmd">is_player()</span> returns false for newly created objects.</p>
    <p>In addition, the new object inherits all of the other properties on
    <var>parent</var>.  These properties have the same permission bits as on
    <var>parent</var>.  If the <span class="cmd">c</span> permissions bit is set, then the owner of the
    property on the new object is the same as the owner of the new object itself;
    otherwise, the owner of the property on the new object is the same as that on
    <var>parent</var>.  The initial value of every inherited property is <em>clear</em>;
    see the description of the built-in function <span class="cmd">clear_property()</span> for
    details.</p>
    <p>If the intended owner of the new object has a property named
    <span class="cmd">ownership_quota</span> and the value of that property is an integer, then
    <span class="cmd">create()</span> treats that value as a <em>quota</em>.  If the quota is less than
    or equal to zero, then the quota is considered to be exhausted and
    <span class="cmd">create()</span> raises <span class="cmd">E_QUOTA</span> instead of creating an object.
    Otherwise, the quota is decremented and stored back into the

    <p>Changing an object's parent can have the effect of removing some properties
    from and adding some other properties to that object and all of its descendants
    (i.e., its children and its children's children, etc.).  Let <var>common</var> be
    the nearest ancestor that <var>object</var> and <var>new-parent</var> have in common
    before the parent of <var>object</var> is changed.  Then all properties defined by
    ancestors of <var>object</var> under <var>common</var> (that is, those ancestors of
    <var>object</var> that are in turn descendants of <var>common</var>) are removed from
    <var>object</var> and all of its descendants.  All properties defined by
    <var>new-parent</var> or its ancestors under <var>common</var> are added to <var>object</var>
    and all of its descendants.  As with <span class="cmd">create()</span>, the newly-added
    properties are given the same permission bits as they have on <var>new-parent</var>,
    the owner of each added property is either the owner of the object it's added
    to (if the <span class="cmd">c</span> permissions bit is set) or the owner of that property on
    <var>new-parent</var>, and the value of each added property is <em>clear</em>; see the
    description of the built-in function <span class="cmd">clear_property()</span> for details.  All
    properties that are not removed or added in the reparenting process are
    completely unchanged.</p>
    <p>If <var>new-parent</var> is equal to <span class="cmd">#-1</span>, then <var>object</var> is given no
    parent at all; it becomes a new root of the parent/child hierarchy.  In this
    case, all formerly inherited properties on <var>object</var> are simply removed.</p>

<article class="well bg-info text-info" id="function-is-member">
    <strong><u>Function:</u> <span class="cmd">list <b>verbs</span> (obj <var>object</var>)</div>

Returns a list of the names of the verbs defined directly on the given

</dl></p>
<p>Most of the remaining operations on verbs accept a string containing the verb's
name to identify the verb in question.  Because verbs can have multiple names
and because an object can have multiple verbs with the same name, this practice
can lead to difficulties.  To most unambiguously refer to a particular verb,
one can instead use a positive integer, the index of the verb in the list
returned by <span class="cmd">verbs()</span>, described above.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that <span class="cmd">verbs(#34)</span> returns this list:</p>
<pre>
{"foo", "bar", "baz", "foo"}
</pre>
<p>Object <span class="cmd">#34</span> has two verbs named <span class="cmd">foo</span> defined on it (this may not be
an error, if the two verbs have different command syntaxes).  To refer
unambiguously to the first one in the list, one uses the integer 1; to refer to
the other one, one uses 4.</p>
<p>In the function descriptions below, an argument named <var>verb-desc</var> is either
a string containing the name of a verb or else a positive integer giving the
index of that verb in its defining object's <span class="cmd">verbs()</span> list.
<blockquote>
</p>
<p>For historical reasons, there is also a second, inferior mechanism for
referring to verbs with numbers, but its use is strongly discouraged.  If the
property <span class="cmd">$server_options.support_numeric_verbname_strings</span> exists with a
true value, then functions on verbs will also accept a numeric string (e.g.,
<span class="cmd">"4"</span>) as a verb descriptor.  The decimal integer in the string works
more-or-less like the positive integers described above, but with two
significant differences:
<ol>
<li>

The numeric string is a <em>zero-based</em> index into <span class="cmd">verbs()</span>; that is,
in the string case, you would use the number one less than what you would use
in the positive integer case.

<li>

When there exists a verb whose actual name looks like a decimal integer, this
numeric-string notation is ambiguous; the server will in all cases assume that
the reference is to the first verb in the list for which the given string could
be a name, either in the normal sense or as a numeric index.
</ol>

</p>
<p>Clearly, this older mechanism is more difficult and risky to use; new code
should only be written to use the current mechanism, and old code using numeric
strings should be modified not to do so.

<p>The server will not queue an arbitrary amount of output for a connection; the

over its limit, it first tries to write as much output as possible to the

the new output being able to fit in the queue, the server starts throwing away
the oldest lines in the queue until the new ouput will fit.  The server
remembers how many lines of output it has `flushed' in this way and, when next
it can succeed in writing anything to the connection, it first writes a line

the current task, resuming it when there is input available to be read.  If

responsibility to the programmer, however.  If your program calls another verb
before doing a <span class="cmd">read()</span>, then either that verb must not suspend or else
you must arrange that no commands will be read from the connection in the
meantime.  The most straightforward way to do this is to call
</p>
<pre>
set_connection_option(player, "hold-input", 1)
</pre>
<p>before any task suspension could happen, then make all of your calls to
<span class="cmd">read()</span> and other code that might suspend, and finally call

If <var>value</var> is true, then both input from and output to <var>conn</var> can

Establishes a network connection to the place specified by the arguments and
more-or-less pretends that a new, normal player connection has been established
from there.  The new connection, as usual, will not be logged in initially and
will have a negative object number associated with it for use with

be returned, depending upon the particular network implementation in use.</p>
<p>For the TCP/IP network implementations (the only ones as of this writing that
support outbound connections), there must be two arguments, a string naming a
host (possibly using the numeric Internet syntax) and an integer specifying a TCP
port.  If a connection cannot be made because the host does not exist, the port
does not exist, the host is not reachable or refused the connection,
<span class="cmd">E_INVARG</span> is raised.  If the connection cannot be made for other
reasons, including resource limitations, then <span class="cmd">E_QUOTA</span> is raised.</p>
<p>The outbound connection process involves certain steps that can take quite a
long time, during which the server is not doing anything else, including
responding to user commands and executing MOO tasks.  See the chapter on
server assumptions about the database for details about how the server limits
the amount of time it will wait for these steps to successfully complete.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning one tricky point concerning the use of this function.
Since the server treats the new connection pretty much like any normal player
connection, it will naturally try to parse any input from that connection as
commands in the usual way.  To prevent this treatment, you should use
<span class="cmd">set_connection_option()</span> to set the <span class="cmd">"hold-input"</span> option true on
the connection.

</pre>
<p>where <var>name</var> is the name of the built-in function, <var>min-args</var> is the
minimum number of arguments that must be provided to the function,
<var>max-args</var> is the maximum number of arguments that can be provided to the

acceptable and <span class="cmd">-2</span> indicates that either integers or floating-point

    <strong><u>Function:</u> <span class="cmd">value <b>suspend</span> ([int <var>seconds</var>])</div>
<dd><a name="IDX112"></a>
Suspends the current task, and resumes it after at least <var>seconds</var> seconds.
(If <var>seconds</var> is not provided, the task is suspended indefinitely; such a
task can only be resumed by use of the <span class="cmd">resume()</span> function.)  When the
task is resumed, it will have a full quota of ticks and seconds.  This function
is useful for programs that run for a long time or require a lot of ticks.  If
<var>seconds</var> is negative, then <span class="cmd">E_INVARG</span> is raised.  <span class="cmd">Suspend()</span>
returns zero unless it was resumed via <span class="cmd">resume()</span>, in which case it
returns the second argument given to that function.</p>
<p>In some sense, this function forks the `rest' of the executing task.  However,
there is a major difference between the use of <span class="cmd">suspend(<var>seconds</var>)</span>
and the use of the <span class="cmd">fork (<var>seconds</var>)</span>.  The <span class="cmd">fork</span> statement
creates a new task (a <em>forked task</em>) while the currently-running task still
goes on to completion, but a <span class="cmd">suspend()</span> suspends the currently-running
task (thus making it into a <em>suspended task</em>).  This difference may be best
explained by the following examples, in which one verb calls another:</p>
<pre>
.program   #0:caller_A
#0.prop = 1;
#0:callee_A();
#0.prop = 2;
.

.program   #0:callee_A
fork(5)
  #0.prop = 3;
endfork
.

.program   #0:caller_B
#0.prop = 1;
#0:callee_B();
#0.prop = 2;
.

.program   #0:callee_B
suspend(5);
#0.prop = 3;
.
</pre>
<p>Consider <span class="cmd">#0:caller_A</span>, which calls <span class="cmd">#0:callee_A</span>.  Such a task would
assign 1 to <span class="cmd">#0.prop</span>, call <span class="cmd">#0:callee_A</span>, fork a new task, return to
<span class="cmd">#0:caller_A</span>, and assign 2 to <span class="cmd">#0.prop</span>, ending this task.  Five
seconds later, if the forked task had not been killed, then it would begin to
run; it would assign 3 to <span class="cmd">#0.prop</span> and then stop.  So, the final value of
<span class="cmd">#0.prop</span> (i.e., the value after more than 5 seconds) would be 3.</p>
<p>Now consider <span class="cmd">#0:caller_B</span>, which calls <span class="cmd">#0:callee_B</span> instead of
<span class="cmd">#0:callee_A</span>.  This task would assign 1 to <span class="cmd">#0.prop</span>, call
<span class="cmd">#0:callee_B</span>, and suspend.  Five seconds later, if the suspended task had
not been killed, then it would resume; it would assign 3 to <span class="cmd">#0.prop</span>,
return to <span class="cmd">#0:caller_B</span>, and assign 2 to <span class="cmd">#0.prop</span>, ending the task.
So, the final value of <span class="cmd">#0.prop</span> (i.e., the value after more than 5
seconds) would be 2.</p>
<p>A suspended task, like a forked task, can be described by the
<span class="cmd">queued_tasks()</span> function and killed by the <span class="cmd">kill_task()</span> function.
Suspending a task does not change its task id.  A task can be suspended again
and again by successive calls to <span class="cmd">suspend()</span>.</p>
<p>By default, there is no limit to the number of tasks any player may suspend,
but such a limit can be imposed from within the database.  See the chapter on
server assumptions about the database for details.

<h1><a name="SEC56" href="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC56">Server Commands and Database Assumptions</a></h1>

</p>
<p>This chapter describes all of the commands that are built into the server and
every property and verb in the database specifically accessed by the server.
Aside from what is listed here, no assumptions are made by the server
concerning the contents of the database.

<h2><a name="SEC57" href="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC57">Built-in Commands</a></h2>

</p>
<p>As was mentioned in the chapter on command parsing, there are five commands
whose interpretation is fixed by the server: <span class="cmd">PREFIX</span>,
<span class="cmd">OUTPUTPREFIX</span>, <span class="cmd">SUFFIX</span>, <span class="cmd">OUTPUTSUFFIX</span>, and <span class="cmd">.program</span>.
The first four of these are intended for use by programs that connect to the
MOO, so-called `client' programs.  The <span class="cmd">.program</span> command is used by
programmers to associate a MOO program with a particular verb.  The server can,
in addition, recognize a sixth special command on any or all connections, the
<em>flush</em> command.</p>
<p>The server also performs special processing on command lines that begin with
certain punctuation characters.</p>
<p>This section discusses these built-in pieces of the command-interpretation

</p>
<p>Every MOO network connection has associated with it two strings, the
<em>output prefix</em> and the <em>output suffix</em>.  Just before executing a
command typed on that connection, the server prints the output prefix, if any,
to the player.  Similarly, just after finishing the command, the output suffix,
if any, is printed to the player.  Initially, these strings are not defined, so
no extra printing takes place.</p>
<p>The <span class="cmd">PREFIX</span> and <span class="cmd">SUFFIX</span> commands are used to set and clear these
strings.  They have the following simple syntax:</p>
<pre>
PREFIX  <var>output-prefix</var>
SUFFIX  <var>output-suffix</var>
</pre>
<p>That is, all text after the command name and any following spaces is used as
the new value of the appropriate string.  If there is no non-blank text after
the command string, then the corresponding string is cleared.  For
compatibility with some general MUD client programs, the server also recognizes
<span class="cmd">OUTPUTPREFIX</span> as a synonym for <span class="cmd">PREFIX</span> and <span class="cmd">OUTPUTSUFFIX</span> as a
synonym for <span class="cmd">SUFFIX</span>.</p>
<p>These commands are intended for use by programs connected to the MOO, so that
they can issue MOO commands and reliably determine the beginning and end of the
resulting output.  For example, one editor-based client program sends this
sequence of commands on occasion:</p>
<pre>
PREFIX &#62;&#62;MOO-Prefix&#60;&#60;
SUFFIX &#62;&#62;MOO-Suffix&#60;&#60;
@list <var>object</var>:<var>verb</var> without numbers
PREFIX
SUFFIX
</pre>
<p>The effect of which, in a LambdaCore-derived database, is to print out the code
for the named verb preceded by a line containing only <span class="cmd">&#62;&#62;MOO-Prefix&#60;&#60;</span> and
followed by a line containing only <span class="cmd">&#62;&#62;MOO-Suffix&#60;&#60;</span>.  This enables the
editor to reliably extract the program text from the MOO output and show it to
the user in a separate editor window.  There are many other possible uses.</p>
<p>The built-in function <span class="cmd">output_delimiters()</span> can be used by MOO code to
find out the output prefix and suffix currently in effect on a particular
network connection.

<h3><a name="SEC59" href="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC59">Programming</a></h3>

</p>
<p>The <span class="cmd">.program</span> command is a common way for programmers to associate a
particular MOO-code program with a particular verb.  It has the following
syntax:</p>
<pre>
.program <var>object</var>:<var>verb</var>
...<var>several lines of MOO code</var>...
.
</pre>
<p>That is, after typing the <span class="cmd">.program</span> command, then all lines of input from
the player are considered to be a part of the MOO program being defined.  This
ends as soon as the player types a line containing only a dot (<span class="cmd">.</span>).  When
that line is received, the accumulated MOO program is checked for proper MOO
syntax and, if correct, associated with the named verb.</p>
<p>If, at the time the line containing only a dot is processed, (a) the player is
not a programmer, (b) the player does not have write permission on the named
verb, or (c) the property <span class="cmd">$server_options.protect_set_verb_code</span> exists
and has a true value and the player is not a wizard, then an error message is
printed and the named verb's program is not changed.</p>
<p>In the <span class="cmd">.program</span> command, <var>object</var> may have one of three forms:
<ul>
<li>

The name of some object visible to the player.  This is exactly like the kind
of matching done by the server for the direct and indirect objects of ordinary
commands.  See the chapter on command parsing for details.  Note that the
special names <span class="cmd">me</span> and <span class="cmd">here</span> may be used.

<li>

An object number, in the form <span class="cmd">#<var>number</var></span>.

<li>

A <em>system property</em> (that is, a property on <span class="cmd">#0</span>), in the form
<span class="cmd">$<var>name</var></span>.  In this case, the current value of <span class="cmd">#0.<var>name</var></span>
must be a valid object.
</ul>
<h3><a name="SEC60" href="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC60">Flushing Unprocessed Input</a></h3>

</p>
<p>It sometimes happens that a user changes their mind about having typed one or
more lines of input and would like to `untype' them before the server actually
gets around to processing them.  If they react quickly enough, they can type
their connection's defined <em>flush</em> command; when the server first reads
that command from the network, it immediately and completely flushes any as-yet
unprocessed input from that user, printing a message to the user describing
just which lines of input were discarded, if any.
<blockquote>
</p>
<p><em>Fine point:</em> The flush command is handled very early in the server's
processing of a line of input, before the line is entered into the task queue
for the connection and well before it is parsed into words like other commands.
For this reason, it must be typed exactly as it was defined, alone on the line,
without quotation marks, and without any spaces before or after it.
</blockquote>

</p>
<p>When a connection is first accepted by the server, it is given an initial flush
command setting taken from the current default.  This initial setting can be
changed later using the <span class="cmd">set_connection_option()</span> command.</p>
<p>By default, each connection is initially given <span class="cmd">.flush</span> as its flush
command.  If the property <span class="cmd">$server_options.default_flush_command</span> exists,
then its value overrides this default.  If
<span class="cmd">$server_options.default_flush_command</span> is a non-empty string, then that
string is the flush command for all new connections; otherwise, new connections
are initially given no flush command at all.

<h3><a name="SEC61" href="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC61">Initial Punctuation in Commands</a></h3>

</p>
<p>The server interprets command lines that begin with any of the following
characters specially:</p>
<pre>
"        :        ;
</pre>
<p>Before processing the command, the initial punctuation character is replaced by
the corresponding word below, followed by a space:</p>
<pre>
say      emote    eval
</pre>
<p>For example, the command line</p>
<pre>
"Hello, there.
</pre>
<p>is transformed into</p>
<pre>
say Hello, there.
</pre>
<p>before parsing.

<h2><a name="SEC62" href="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC62">Server Assumptions About the Database</a></h2>

</p>
<p>There are a small number of circumstances under which the server directly and
specifically accesses a particular verb or property in the database.  This
section gives a complete list of such circumstances.

<h3><a name="SEC63" href="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC63">Server Options Set in the Database</a></h3>

</p>
<p>Many optional behaviors of the server can be controlled from within the
database by creating the property <span class="cmd">#0.server_options</span> (also known as
<span class="cmd">$server_options</span>), assigning as its value a valid object number, and then
defining various properties on that object.  At a number of times, the server
checks for whether the property <span class="cmd">$server_options</span> exists and has an object
number as its value.  If so, then the server looks for a variety of other
properties on that <span class="cmd">$server_options</span> object and, if they exist, uses their
values to control how the server operates.</p>
<p>The specific properties searched for are each described in the appropriate
section below, but here is a brief list of all of the relevant properties for
ease of reference:<dl COMPACT>

<dt><span class="cmd">bg_seconds</span>
<dd>
The number of seconds allotted to background tasks.

Enables use of an obsolete verb-naming mechanism.
</dl>
<h3><a name="SEC64" href="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC64">Server Messages Set in the Database</a></h3>

</p>
<p>There are a number of circumstances under which the server itself generates
messages on network connections.  Most of these can be customized or even
eliminated from within the database.  In each such case, a property on
<span class="cmd">$server_options</span> is checked at the time the message would be printed.  If
the property does not exist, a default message is printed.  If the property
exists and its value is not a string or a list containing strings, then no
message is printed at all.  Otherwise, the string(s) are printed in place of
the default message, one string per line.  None of these messages are ever
printed on an outbound network connection created by the function
<span class="cmd">open_network_connection()</span>.</p>
<p>The following list covers all of the customizable messages, showing for each
the name of the relevant property on <span class="cmd">$server_options</span>, the default
message, and the circumstances under which the message is printed:<dl COMPACT>

<dt><span class="cmd">boot_msg = "*** Disconnected ***"</span>
<dd>
The function <span class="cmd">boot_player()</span> was called on this connection.

<dt><span class="cmd">connect_msg = "*** Connected ***"</span>
<dd>
The user object that just logged in on this connection existed before
<span class="cmd">$do_login_command()</span> was called.

<dt><span class="cmd">create_msg = "*** Created ***"</span>
<dd>
The user object that just logged in on this connection did not exist before
<span class="cmd">$do_login_command()</span> was called.

<dt><span class="cmd">recycle_msg = "*** Recycled ***"</span>
<dd>
The logged-in user of this connection has been recycled or renumbered (via the
renumber() function).

<dt><span class="cmd">redirect_from_msg = "*** Redirecting connection to new port ***"</span>
<dd>
The logged-in user of this connection has just logged in on some other
connection.

<dt><span class="cmd">redirect_to_msg = "*** Redirecting old connection to this port ***"</span>
<dd>
The user who just logged in on this connection was already logged in on some
other connection.

<dt><span class="cmd">server_full_msg</span>
<dd>
Default:
</p>
<pre>
*** Sorry, but the server cannot accept any more connections right now.
*** Please try again later.
</pre>

This connection arrived when the server really couldn't accept any more
connections, due to running out of a critical operating system resource.

<dt><span class="cmd">timeout_msg = "*** Timed-out waiting for login. ***"</span>
<dd>
This in-bound network connection was idle and un-logged-in for at least
<span class="cmd">CONNECT_TIMEOUT</span> seconds (as defined in the file <span class="cmd">options.h</span> when
the server was compiled).
</dl><blockquote>
</p>
<p><em>Fine point:</em> If the network connection in question was received at a
listening point (established by the <span class="cmd">listen()</span> function) handled by an
object <var>obj</var> other than <span class="cmd">#0</span>, then system messages for that connection
are looked for on <span class="cmd"><var>obj</var>.server_options</span>; if that property does not
exist, then <span class="cmd">$server_options</span> is used instead.
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="SEC65" href="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC65">Checkpointing the Database</a></h3>

</p>
<p>The server maintains the entire MOO database in main memory, not on disk.  It
is therefore necessary for it to dump the database to disk if it is to persist
beyond the lifetime of any particular server execution.  The server is careful
to dump the database just before shutting down, of course, but it is also
prudent for it to do so at regular intervals, just in case something untoward
happens.</p>
<p>To determine how often to make these <em>checkpoints</em> of the database, the
server consults the value of <span class="cmd">#0.dump_interval</span>.  If it exists and its
value is an integer greater than or equal to 60, then it is taken as the number
of seconds to wait between checkpoints; otherwise, the server makes a new
checkpoint every 3600 seconds (one hour).  If the value of
<span class="cmd">#0.dump_interval</span> implies that the next checkpoint should be scheduled at
a time after 3:14:07 a.m. on Tuesday, January 19, 2038, then the server instead
uses the default value of 3600 seconds in the future.</p>
<p>The decision about how long to wait between checkpoints is made again
immediately after each one begins.  Thus, changes to <span class="cmd">#0.dump_interval</span>
will take effect after the next checkpoint happens.</p>
<p>Whenever the server begins to make a checkpoint, it makes the following verb
call:</p>
<pre>
$checkpoint_started()
</pre>
<p>When the checkpointing process is complete, the server makes the following verb
call:</p>
<pre>
$checkpoint_finished(<var>success</var>)
</pre>
<p>where <var>success</var> is true if and only if the checkpoint was successfully
written on the disk.  Checkpointing can fail for a number of reasons, usually
due to exhaustion of various operating system resources such as virtual memory
or disk space.  It is not an error if either of these verbs does not exist; the
corresponding call is simply skipped.

<h3><a name="SEC66" href="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC66">Accepting and Initiating Network Connections</a></h3>

</p>
<p>When the server first accepts a new, incoming network connection, it is given
the low-level network address of computer on the other end.  It immediately
attempts to convert this address into the human-readable host name that will be
entered in the server log and returned by the <span class="cmd">connection_name()</span>
function.  This conversion can, for the TCP/IP networking configurations,
involve a certain amount of communication with remote name servers, which can
take quite a long time and/or fail entirely.  While the server is doing this
conversion, it is not doing anything else at all; in particular, it it not
responding to user commands or executing MOO tasks.</p>
<p>By default, the server will wait no more than 5 seconds for such a name lookup
to succeed; after that, it behaves as if the conversion had failed, using
instead a printable representation of the low-level address.  If the property
<span class="cmd">name_lookup_timeout</span> exists on <span class="cmd">$server_options</span> and has an integer
as its value, that integer is used instead as the timeout interval.</p>
<p>When the <span class="cmd">open_network_connection()</span> function is used, the server must
again do a conversion, this time from the host name given as an argument into
the low-level address necessary for actually opening the connection.  This
conversion is subject to the same timeout as in the in-bound case; if the
conversion does not succeed before the timeout expires, the connection attempt
is aborted and <span class="cmd">open_network_connection()</span> raises <span class="cmd">E_QUOTA</span>.</p>
<p>After a successful conversion, though, the server must still wait for the
actual connection to be accepted by the remote computer.  As before, this can
take a long time during which the server is again doing nothing else.  Also as
before, the server will by default wait no more than 5 seconds for the
connection attempt to succeed; if the timeout expires,
<span class="cmd">open_network_connection()</span> again raises <span class="cmd">E_QUOTA</span>.  This default
timeout interval can also be overridden from within the database, by defining
the property <span class="cmd">outbound_connect_timeout</span> on <span class="cmd">$server_options</span> with an
integer as its value.

<h3><a name="SEC67" href="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC67">Associating Network Connections with Players</a></h3>

</p>
<p>When a network connection is first made to the MOO, it is identified by a
unique, negative object number.  Such a connection is said to be
<em>un-logged-in</em> and is not yet associated with any MOO player object.</p>
<p>Each line of input on an un-logged-in connection is first parsed into words in
the usual way (see the chapter on command parsing for details) and then these
words are passed as the arguments in a call to the verb
<span class="cmd">$do_login_command()</span>.  For example, the input line</p>
<pre>
connect Munchkin frebblebit
</pre>
<p>would result in the following call being made:</p>
<pre>
$do_login_command("connect", "Munchkin", "frebblebit")
</pre>
<p>In that call, the variable <span class="cmd">player</span> will have as its value the negative
object number associated with the appropriate network connection.  The
functions <span class="cmd">notify()</span> and <span class="cmd">boot_player()</span> can be used with such object
numbers to send output to and disconnect un-logged-in connections.  Also, the
variable <span class="cmd">argstr</span> will have as its value the unparsed command line as
received on the network connection.</p>
<p>If <span class="cmd">$do_login_command()</span> returns a valid player object and the connection
is still open, then the connection is considered to have <em>logged into</em> that
player.  The server then makes one of the following verbs calls, depending on
the player object that was returned:</p>
<pre>
$user_created(<var>player</var>)
$user_connected(<var>player</var>)
$user_reconnected(<var>player</var>)
</pre>
<p>The first of these is used if the returned object number is greater than the
value returned by the <span class="cmd">max_object()</span> function before
<span class="cmd">$do_login_command()</span> was invoked, that is, it is called if the returned
object appears to have been freshly created.  If this is not the case, then one
of the other two verb calls is used.  The <span class="cmd">$user_connected()</span> call is used
if there was no existing active connection for the returned player object.
Otherwise, the <span class="cmd">$user_reconnected()</span> call is used instead.
<blockquote>
</p>
<p><em>Fine point:</em> If a user reconnects and the user's old and new connections
are on two different listening points being handled by different objects (see
the description of the <span class="cmd">listen()</span> function for more details), then
<span class="cmd">user_client_disconnected</span> is called for the old connection and
<span class="cmd">user_connected</span> for the new one.
</blockquote>

</p>
<p>If an in-bound network connection does not successfully log in within a certain
period of time, the server will automatically shut down the connection, thereby
freeing up the resources associated with maintaining it.  Let <var>L</var> be the
object handling the listening point on which the connection was received (or
<span class="cmd">#0</span> if the connection came in on the initial listening point).  To
discover the timeout period, the server checks on
<span class="cmd"><var>L</var>.server_options</span> or, if it doesn't exist, on
<span class="cmd">$server_options</span> for a <span class="cmd">connect_timeout</span> property.  If one is found
and its value is a positive integer, then that's the number of seconds the
server will use for the timeout period.  If the <span class="cmd">connect_timeout</span> property
exists but its value isn't a positive integer, then there is no timeout at
all.  If the property doesn't exist, then the default timeout is 300 seconds.</p>
<p>When any network connection (even an un-logged-in or outbound one) is
terminated, by either the server or the client, then one of the following two
verb calls is made:</p>
<pre>
$user_disconnected(<var>player</var>)
$user_client_disconnected(<var>player</var>)
</pre>
<p>The first is used if the disconnection is due to actions taken by the server
(e.g., a use of the <span class="cmd">boot_player()</span> function or the un-logged-in timeout
described above) and the second if the disconnection was initiated by the
client side.</p>
<p>It is not an error if any of these five verbs do not exist; the corresponding
call is simply skipped.
<blockquote>
</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Only one network connection can be controlling a given player
object at a given time; should a second connection attempt to log in as that
player, the first connection is unceremoniously closed (and
<span class="cmd">$user_reconnected()</span> called, as described above).  This makes it easy to
recover from various kinds of network problems that leave connections open but
inaccessible.
</blockquote>

</p>
<p>When the network connection is first established, the null command is
automatically entered by the server, resulting in an initial call to
<span class="cmd">$do_login_command()</span> with no arguments.  This signal can be used by the
verb to print out a welcome message, for example.
<blockquote>
</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: If there is no <span class="cmd">$do_login_command()</span> verb defined, then
lines of input from un-logged-in connections are simply discarded.  Thus, it is
<em>necessary</em> for any database to include a suitable definition for this
verb.
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="SEC68" href="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC68">Out-of-Band Commands</a></h3>

</p>
<p>It is possible to compile the server with an option defining an
<em>out-of-band prefix</em> for commands.  This is a string that the server will
check for at the beginning of every line of input from players, regardless of
whether or not those players are logged in and regardless of whether or not
reading tasks are waiting for input from those players.  If a given line of
input begins with the defined out-of-band prefix (leading spaces, if any, are
<em>not</em> stripped before testing), then it is not treated as a normal command
or as input to any reading task.  Instead, the line is parsed into a list of
words in the usual way and those words are given as the arguments in a call to
<span class="cmd">$do_out_of_band_command()</span>.  For example, if the out-of-band prefix were
defined to be <span class="cmd">#$#</span>, then the line of input</p>
<pre>
#$# client-type fancy
</pre>
<p>would result in the following call being made in a new server task:</p>
<pre>
$do_out_of_band_command("#$#", "client-type", "fancy")
</pre>
<p>During the call to <span class="cmd">$do_out_of_band_command()</span>, the variable <span class="cmd">player</span>
is set to the object number representing the player associated with the
connection from which the input line came.  Of course, if that connection has
not yet logged in, the object number will be negative.  Also, the variable
<span class="cmd">argstr</span> will have as its value the unparsed input line as received on the
network connection.</p>
<p>Out-of-band commands are intended for use by fancy client programs that may
generate asynchronous <em>events</em> of which the server must be notified.  Since
the client cannot, in general, know the state of the player's connection
(logged-in or not, reading task or not), out-of-band commands provide the only
reliable client-to-server communications channel.

<h3><a name="SEC69" href="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC69">The First Tasks Run By the Server</a></h3>

</p>
<p>Whenever the server is booted, there are a few tasks it runs right at the
beginning, before accepting connections or getting the value of
<span class="cmd">#0.dump_interval</span> to schedule the first checkpoint (see below for more
information on checkpoint scheduling).</p>
<p>First, the server calls <span class="cmd">$user_disconnected()</span> once for each user who
was connected at the time the database file was written; this allows for any
cleaning up that's usually done when users disconnect (e.g., moving their
player objects back to some `home' location, etc.).</p>
<p>Next, it checks for the existence of the verb <span class="cmd">$server_started()</span>.  If
there is such a verb, then the server runs a task invoking that verb with no
arguments and with <span class="cmd">player</span> equal to <span class="cmd">#-1</span>.  This is useful for
carefully scheduling checkpoints and for re-initializing any state that is not
properly represented in the database file (e.g., re-opening certain outbound
network connections, clearing out certain tables, etc.).

<h3><a name="SEC70" href="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC70">Controlling the Execution of Tasks</a></h3>

</p>
<p>As described earlier, in the section describing MOO tasks, the server places
limits on the number of seconds for which any task may run continuously and the
number of "ticks," or low-level operations, any task may execute in one
unbroken period.  By default, foreground tasks may use 30,000 ticks and five
seconds, and background tasks may use 15,000 ticks and three seconds.  These
defaults can be overridden from within the database by defining any or all of
the following properties on <span class="cmd">$server_options</span> and giving them integer
values:<dl COMPACT>

<dt><span class="cmd">bg_seconds</span>
<dd>
The number of seconds allotted to background tasks.
<dt><span class="cmd">bg_ticks</span>
<dd>
The number of ticks allotted to background tasks.
<dt><span class="cmd">fg_seconds</span>
<dd>
The number of seconds allotted to foreground tasks.
<dt><span class="cmd">fg_ticks</span>
<dd>
The number of ticks allotted to foreground tasks.
</dl>

</p>
<p>The server ignores the values of <span class="cmd">fg_ticks</span> and <span class="cmd">bg_ticks</span> if they
are less than 100 and similarly ignores <span class="cmd">fg_seconds</span> and <span class="cmd">bg_seconds</span>
if their values are less than 1.  This may help prevent utter disaster should
you accidentally give them uselessly-small values.</p>
<p>Recall that command tasks and server tasks are deemed <em>foreground</em> tasks,
while forked, suspended, and reading tasks are defined as <em>background</em>
tasks.  The settings of these variables take effect only at the beginning of
execution or upon resumption of execution after suspending or reading.</p>
<p>The server also places a limit on the number of levels of nested verb calls,
raising <span class="cmd">E_MAXREC</span> from a verb-call expression if the limit is exceeded.
The limit is 50 levels by default, but this can be increased from within the
database by defining the <span class="cmd">max_stack_depth</span> property on
<span class="cmd">$server_options</span> and giving it an integer value greater than 50.  The
maximum stack depth for any task is set at the time that task is created and
cannot be changed thereafter.  This implies that suspended tasks, even after
being saved in and restored from the DB, are not affected by later changes to
$server_options.max_stack_depth.</p>
<p>Finally, the server can place a limit on the number of forked or suspended
tasks any player can have queued at a given time.  Each time a <span class="cmd">fork</span>
statement or a call to <span class="cmd">suspend()</span> is executed in some verb, the server
checks for a property named <span class="cmd">queued_task_limit</span> on the programmer.  If
that property exists and its value is a non-negative integer, then that integer
is the limit.  Otherwise, if <span class="cmd">$server_options.queued_task_limit</span> exists
and its value is a non-negative integer, then that's the limit.  Otherwise,
there is no limit.  If the programmer already has a number of queued tasks that
is greater than or equal to the limit, <span class="cmd">E_QUOTA</span> is raised instead of
either forking or suspending.  Reading tasks are affected by the queued-task
limit.

<h3><a name="SEC71" href="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC71">Controlling the Handling of Aborted Tasks</a></h3>

</p>
<p>The server will abort the execution of tasks for either of two reasons:

<ol>
<li>an error was raised within the task but not caught, or

<li>the task exceeded the limits on ticks and/or seconds.

</ol>

</p>
<p>In each case, after aborting the task, the server attempts to call a particular
<em>handler verb</em> within the database to allow code there to handle this
mishap in some appropriate way.  If this verb call suspends or returns a true
value, then it is considered to have handled the situation completely and no
further processing will be done by the server.  On the other hand, if the
handler verb does not exist, or if the call either returns a false value
without suspending or itself is aborted, the server takes matters into its own
hands.</p>
<p>First, an error message and a MOO verb-call stack <em>traceback</em> are
printed to the player who typed the command that created the original aborted
task, explaining why the task was aborted and where in the task the problem
occurred.  Then, if the call to the handler verb was itself aborted, a second
error message and traceback are printed, describing that problem as well.  Note
that if the handler-verb call itself is aborted, no further `nested' handler
calls are made; this policy prevents what might otherwise be quite a vicious
little cycle.</p>
<p>The specific handler verb, and the set of arguments it is passed, differs for
the two causes of aborted tasks.</p>
<p>If an error is raised and not caught, then the verb-call
</p>
<pre>
$handle_uncaught_error(<var>code</var>, <var>msg</var>, <var>value</var>, <var>traceback</var>, <var>formatted</var>)
</pre>
<p>is made, where <var>code</var>, <var>msg</var>, <var>value</var>, and <var>traceback</var> are the
values that would have been passed to a handler in a <span class="cmd">try</span>-<span class="cmd">except</span>
statement and <var>formatted</var> is a list of strings being the lines of error and
traceback output that will be printed to the player if
<span class="cmd">$handle_uncaught_error</span> returns false without suspending.</p>
<p>If a task runs out of ticks or seconds, then the verb-call
</p>
<pre>
$handle_task_timeout(<var>resource</var>, <var>traceback</var>, <var>formatted</var>)
</pre>
<p>is made, where <var>resource</var> is the appropriate one of the strings
<span class="cmd">"ticks"</span> or <span class="cmd">"seconds"</span>, and <var>traceback</var> and <var>formatted</var> are
as above.

<h3><a name="SEC72" href="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC72">Matching in Command Parsing</a></h3>

</p>
<p>In the process of matching the direct and indirect object strings in a command
to actual objects, the server uses the value of the <span class="cmd">aliases</span> property, if
any, on each object in the contents of the player and the player's location.
For complete details, see the chapter on command parsing.

<h3><a name="SEC73" href="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC73">Restricting Access to Built-in Properties and Functions</a></h3>

</p>
<p>Whenever verb code attempts to read the value of a built-in property <var>prop</var>
on any object, the server checks to see if the property
<span class="cmd">$server_options.protect_<var>prop</var></span> exists and has a true value.  If so,
then <span class="cmd">E_PERM</span> is raised if the programmer is not a wizard.</p>
<p>Whenever verb code calls a built-in function <span class="cmd"><var>func</var>()</span> and the caller
is not the object <span class="cmd">#0</span>, the server checks to see if the property
<span class="cmd">$server_options.protect_<var>func</var></span> exists and has a true value.  If so,
then the server next checks to see if the verb <span class="cmd">$bf_<var>func</var>()</span> exists;
if that verb exists, then the server calls it <em>instead</em> of the built-in
function, returning or raising whatever that verb returns or raises.  If the
<span class="cmd">$bf_<var>func</var>()</span> does not exist and the programmer is not a wizard, then
the server immediately raises <span class="cmd">E_PERM</span>, <em>without</em> actually calling
the function.  Otherwise (if the caller is <span class="cmd">#0</span>, if
<span class="cmd">$server_options.protect_<var>func</var></span> either doesn't exist or has a false
value, or if <span class="cmd">$bf_<var>func</var>()</span> exists but the programmer is a wizard),
then the built-in function is called normally.

<h3><a name="SEC74" href="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC74">Creating and Recycling Objects</a></h3>

</p>
<p>Whenever the <span class="cmd">create()</span> function is used to create a new object, that
object's <span class="cmd">initialize</span> verb, if any, is called with no arguments.  The call
is simply skipped if no such verb is defined on the object.</p>
<p>Symmetrically, just before the <span class="cmd">recycle()</span> function actually destroys an
object, the object's <span class="cmd">recycle</span> verb, if any, is called with no arguments.
Again, the call is simply skipped if no such verb is defined on the object.</p>
<p>Both <span class="cmd">create()</span> and <span class="cmd">recycle()</span> check for the existence of an
<span class="cmd">ownership_quota</span> property on the owner of the newly-created or -destroyed
object.  If such a property exists and its value is an integer, then it is
treated as a <em>quota</em> on object ownership.  Otherwise, the following two
paragraphs do not apply.</p>
<p>The <span class="cmd">create()</span> function checks whether or not the quota is positive; if
so, it is reduced by one and stored back into the <span class="cmd">ownership_quota</span>
property on the owner.  If the quota is zero or negative, the quota is
considered to be exhausted and <span class="cmd">create()</span> raises <span class="cmd">E_QUOTA</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="cmd">recycle()</span> function increases the quota by one and stores it back
into the <span class="cmd">ownership_quota</span> property on the owner.

<h3><a name="SEC75" href="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC75">Object Movement</a></h3>

</p>
<p>During evaluation of a call to the <span class="cmd">move()</span> function, the server can make
calls on the <span class="cmd">accept</span> and <span class="cmd">enterfunc</span> verbs defined on the
destination of the move and on the <span class="cmd">exitfunc</span> verb defined on the source.
The rules and circumstances are somewhat complicated and are given in detail in
the description of the <span class="cmd">move()</span> function.

<h3><a name="SEC76" href="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC76">Temporarily Enabling Obsolete Server Features</a></h3>

</p>
<p>If the property <span class="cmd">$server_options.support_numeric_verbname_strings</span> exists
and has a true value, then the server supports a obsolete mechanism for less
ambiguously referring to specific verbs in various built-in functions.  For
more details, see the discussion given just following the description of the
<span class="cmd">verbs()</span> function.
